other Flycatchers, breediug iu beech-woods, aud only visiting gardens in their
vicinity. The song is said by Seebohm to be very nnobtrnsive and intermediate
between those of the Robin aud Redstart, and he describes the alarm-note as piuk,
p'nik, pink, something like the spi)ik of a Chaffinch ; probably Naumann's call-note
of this species is the same sound, and he expresses it '' fnid, fiiidr I, therefore,
have no doubt that the true rendering of the note would be '' plnvick"' or '' phivW ;
for no Chaffinch ever had a note the least bit like spink or puik, aud /, not d, is
one of the terminal sounds in bird-notes : Dr. A. Walter, according to Giitke,
describes the call as a rattling sound, but doubtless the latter would be a scolding
note.
In its actions the Red-breasted Flycatcher resembles our other species, some-
times it pursues its prey in the air, but sometimes it picks them from the trunk
of a tree : in addition to insects it also eats small fruits.
The nest is usually placed in a beech-tree, either in a cavity, in trunk, or
branch, or against the trunk, supported by outgrowing twigs ; in form it is a
somewhat deep cup, formed of moss, a few fragments of lichen, and a few soft
feathers ; the lining of fine bents and hairs. The number of the eggs varies from
five to seven, bluish-green, more or less mottled or speckled with rusty-brown,
sometime so densely as almost to conceal the ground-colour, and with greyish-brown
shell-markings : in character they are intermediate between those of the Spotted
Flycatcher and the Robin.
This bird is said to be almost as pugnacious as a Robin ; therefore it would
be well to use caution in associating it with other species iu an aviary. As a
cage-bird it has been both kept and exhibited in Germany, and if reared from the
nest would doubtless be very tame and make a most attractive pet, feeding readily
on the usual soft food; Seebohm, however, states that "birds of this species in
confinement feed upon the common house-fly with great avidity, preferring it to
any artificial food." Doubtless this statement is correct, but it would be quite out
of the question to attempt to feed this, or any other bird upon flies alone.
FAMILY ALAUDIDJ-:.
THE position in which Howard vSannders has phiccd this faniil_y does not
strike one as natural : it would certainly- have fitted in better with one's
sense of order in Nature, to have seen it placed next to the Motaciilidcc,
as in vSeel)ohm's " History of British Birds," and as evidently advocated b}' Dr.
Sharpc, to judge by his remarks on the family in the " Catalogue of Birds."
It is difficult to imagine that the Larks can be more nearly related to the
Crows than to the Pipits, and one wishes that the author of the Manual had in
his arrangement borne out vSeebohm's opinion - "The Larks appear to bear the
same relation to the Pipits that the Thrushes do to the Warblers," or Jerdon's -
"The Larks may be said to grade to the P'inchcs on the one hand, through
Jloiifijniioi/Ia and PUciropluvics ; and, on the other, into the Pipits through
Corydallar
The chief characteristic of the familj- is the scutellation at the back of
the tarsus; and it is probabl}' because of tliis peculiarity (and not becanse
they are allied to the Crows), that Howard Sannders subordinating his own
views, as he sa3-s, " to those of the majorit}- of the B. O. U. Committee re-
specting the positions of the Alaiiiiidic and the Coii'ida'' has placed the Larks
at the end of the Passcrcs, all the other groups having the i'eet scaled only
in front.
The Larks are walking birds, building and in man}' species roosting on
the ground : with the exception of the more arboreal forms, the}- rarely perch
on trees ; and when they do, they select the thicker branches. They do not
wash, but dust themselves after the manner of Sparrows or Gallinaceous birds.
Their food consists of spiders, centipedes, insects, larvae, and seeds or grain.
Larks are powerful flyers, their wings being large and pointed ; the wings
of the males are also as a rule stronger and more elongated than those of the
females, doubtless to enable them to maintain their soaring hovering flight when
singing: as a natural result of this increase of wing-power the sternum is some-
what more prominent, giving greater fulness to the chest. By these characters
the bird-catchers are enabled to tell the sex of Larks directly they grasp them,
the male being, in their own words, "a handful."
Colonel Charles Bingham tells me that the sex of a Lark can always be told
by the length of the hind claw, which is distinctly longer in the males than in
the females.
of all kinds are devoured greedil}', as well as insects, their larvae, and grain. In
the winter lie is more limited and has to content himself with grain, berries, and
such weakly half-starved birds or beasts as he can manage to kill.
Mr. O. V. Aplin ("Zoologist," 1883, p. 409) published the following note on
the food of this species : - " An old disused bridle-gate .standing near one corner
of Clattercutt Reservoir has this season served as a feeding spot for a pair of
Carrion-Crows, which reared their young in a tall elm on one side of the pool.
One evening in June, after the grass was cut, I found strewn around it the
remains of several toads and frogs, and of one partly fledged nestling finch, also
a number of broken shells of the eggs of the Wild Duck and Partridge. The
state the gate was in showed that it was a much frequented perch, and a tell-tale
wing-feather would have named the robber even if he had not hurriedly left an
adjacent tree at my approach, and with loud croaks expressed his displeasure at
my intrusion on his banqueting hall. I have always tried to defend this fine
bird, and was sorry to find such ample proof of its destructive habits. Only a
few days ago (October 1883) I counted thirty-two Crows in a stubble-field close
to this village, and considering their abundance in this district, it is only a
wonder that any game or wildfowl can rear their j'oung at all."
Although inclined to a solitary life during the breeding-season* the Carrion-
Crow is seen in larger or smaller crowds during the autumn and winter : con-
siderable numbers arrive on our eastern coasts in autumn.
Seebohm's statement that this bird "makes almost as engaging a pet as the
Raven" hardly accords with Lord Lilford's opinion of the Carrion-Crow. The
following is Mr. Bonhote's experience, communicated November and, 1896: -
" The Hooded and Carrion-Crows are to be strictly avoided ; the latter bird
when hand-reared is very tame and can articulate a few words, but has no
interesting actions or habits and scarcely moves the whole day. The former bird
(Grey Crow) is not only stupid, but dangerous, and is never satisfied till he has
the whole aviary to himself, having murdered the other inmates."
The Tree-Pipit occurs at Fair Isle, Shetlands, as a bird of spring and autumn
passage, according to W. E. Clarke ; it has been observed on Scilly in the
autumn.
A male of the Red-throated Pipit was shot in Achill, co. Mayo, on May 26th,
1895 ; a second in co. Donegal, on August 9th, 1898, but the latter was considered
doubtful ; a young female was obtained at Ninfield (Sussex), on November 26th,
1901.
In 1903 four Tawny Pipits were shot in September, at Rye Harbour (Sussex),
and a pair on the August following ; another was shot, on the following month
at Bexhill ; a female was caught at Yarmouth, in October 1897, and a male at
Bodmin (Cornwall), in September 1899. Richard's Pipit has also been met with
in Cornwall, North Wales, Scilly and Kentish Knock.
A good many occurrences of the Water- Pipit have been recorded : - one from
Freshwater (Isle of Wight), in September 1865 ; one in Scill3% May 1903 ; one
at Milcomb (Oxford), March 1903 ; one in Norfolk, January 1905 ; one at
Littlestone (Kent), 1906, and altogether over a score in Sussex.
commences late iu August, and sometimes continues up to the middle of
October.
As a cage-bird the Sand-Martin cannot be commended : - wlieu on a nesting
excursion in Kent, in Jul}-, 1887, a family of five little Sand-Martius was brought
to me : as the birds were too j'oiing to let fl}^ I determined to try and keep them
as pets, but I found it a harder task than I had anticipated to induce them to
open their mouths for the food (Abrahams' Nightingale Mixture) which I gave
them. However, after nearly a week's perseverance, my wife and a girl who then
assisted in looking after my birds, succeeded iu persuading four of them to open
their mouths when food was offered. All five were then in excellent health, though
rather too fat : they were very pretty, and when sitting on one's finger, looked
exactly like diminutive hawks. Unfortunately, although by this time the Martins
were well able to fly, they could only be induced to do so if taken into a room
where their food was not in sight. In less than a fortnight they could feed them-
selves, and after that they would eat incessantly, swallowing such huge mouthfuls
of the soft food, that it seemed marvellous where they could stow it all away :
then they would fall asleep, sitting upon the edge of the food-pot, and remain in
a state of stupor for perhaps half-au-hour, when they would wake up and begin
to gorge again. Naturally this life did not agree with birds whose nature it is to
be incessantly on the move, and who get their food slowly and iu minute morsels ;
they grew rapidly thinner and weaker, staggered in their walk as if drunken, and
dropped off one by one, uutil, in just over three weeks from the time when I
received them, the last of them died. Possibly, if it had been practicable for me
to be at home to attend to them, I might have given these birds their food at
stated intervals, and compelled them to take exercise ; in which case, perhaps their
lives might have been prolonged : but Sand-Martius are not suitable birds for
the aviculturist.
tail-feathers have fairly broad yellow luargius ; the feathers of the sides of the
ueck have ashy edges ; the sides and flanks are washed with orange-tawny, the
black spots ou the flanks are less prominent, and the beak becomes bright ochre-
yellow, with brown tip.
The female somewhat resembles the male in winter plnmage bnt is altogether
dnller, the black of the npper parts being replaced by brown, and the bars on the
wings are mnch less prominent. The yonng at first are very like the female,
bnt the males qnickly develop their characteristic colonriug.
The breeding plnmage of the male is acquired without a moult, and it is said
that the change is effected by shedding the tips of the feathers.
Although somewhat less active than the Chafflnch, this species is quite as
quarrelsome in the breeding season (at any rate in confinement) ; in winter, how-
ever, the flocks which travel about through woods and over fields in search of
food agree perfectly with one another and with Chaffinches. Speaking of them as
observed near Sheffield, Seebohm observes: - "They are remarkable noisy birds, and
sit upon the tree-tops twittering to each other until dusk ; they sometimes fly up
into the air in a compact mass, and after wheeling round several times again alight.
They roost in the yew and holly trees, and a fair proportion of them seek quarters
in the ivy."
The site chosen by the Brambliug for its nest is usually at a height of from
fifteen to twenty feet from the ground in a birch or fir-tree, at the junction of a
branch with the trunk; the nest has, however, been found in juniper bushes. In
his "Catalogue of Birds of the Dyke Road Museum, at Brighton," j). 126, the late
Mr. E. T. Booth says: - "In the summer of 1866, while fishing on the river Lyon,
in Perthshire, I had occasion to climb a beech-tree to release the line which had
become entangled in the branches, and while so engaged a female Brambling was
disturbed from her nest, containing three eggs, which was placed close to the stem
of the tree. As I was anxious to procure the young I left her, and ou visiting
the spot in about a fortnight the nest was empty, and, judging by its appearance,
I should be of opinion that the young birds had been dragged out by a cat. This
is the only instance I have ever known of the Brambling attempting to rear its
young in Great Britain."
In the "Field" for July 23rd, 1864, p. 52, the Rev. J. C. Atkinson recorded
the fact of a nest with five or six eggs having been taken at Baldersby Park, near
Thirsk, Yorks., by the Hon. Guy Dawnay.
The nest is larger and more coarsely made than that of the Chaffinch, beiug
formed of white and buff birch-bark, moss, lichens, and spiders' web, and lined
with fine grass and feathers. The eggs, five to seven, usually six, in number, are
ing, and sang regularly in the spring : unfortunately I kept this example in a
cage, and, at its third moult, all its quills grew out like fans, giving the bird
a most wild and uncanny aspect ; indeed it was such an object that I gave it
away to some poor child who took a fancy to it.
About 1889 I again purchased a Brambling from a bird-catcher, and turucd
it iuto a good-sized aviary with other British species : it soon became fairly tame,
sang well each spring, and rarely made itself objectionable to its associates ; it
lived principally upon seed, but ate a certain amount of soft food and any chance
insects which were thrown to it. The plumage of this bird was so perfect that a
friend who greatl}' desired to have it for show- purposes persuaded me to let him
purchase it.
Bramblings have not only bred in confinement, but have been successfully
crossed with Chaffinches. The Natural History Museum at Florence contains
several hybrids between the Brambling and Chaffinch. These specimens show
ample evidence of their origin, and were netted in a wild state by the Italian
bird-catchers.

N February 1905, a male was shot at Rye Harbour, Sussex. It has occurred
twice at Heligoland, once in the north of France, and several times in
Germany.
the Nightingale, the Goldeu Oriole, the Quail, the Black-cap, the Garden Warbler,
the Icterine Warbler, the Meadow-, and Tree-Pipits, and Song-Thrush perfectly,
and portions of the songs of other birds tolerably well. The only pity is that the
voice of this bird is so weak, that it is unable to reproduce the song of many
other cage-birds kept at the same time, but it always repays one to tend and care
for this songster as a cage-bird ; moreover it is easily and cheaply secured, and
also kept alive without difficult}'. This bird, however, should especially be secured
by such aviculturists as cannot put up with too loud a bird-song, and who make
a point of not keeping several birds on account of their dissimilarity of song, for
by its song they will at once be satisfied in both respects."
Of course this savage though pretty bird should never be turned into an
aviary with other birds, as it would undoubtedly murder and devour its companions,
even though as large as itself; a flight cage, therefore, is the most suitable home
for it : the staple food should consist of egg, pieces of cheese, with the addition
of minced raw meat, cockroaches, or other insects, and occasionally a dead mouse
or bird : indeed tlie food for all the Shrikes should be almost exactly the same
as for most of the Corvincr, but somewhat less varied ; because many of the latter
eat fruit, nuts, grain, and even acorns, greedily, as well as the usual soft food.
In 1904, Dr. Albert Glinther bred this species from hand-reared birds turned
into an outdoor aviary. They built in the second week of May in a holly-bush,
four feet from the ground ; the nest was of the usual type and well-built ; it
contained five eggs which were incubated for fourteen days, all being hatched
between the 5th and 6th June : owing to cold weather all died and were removed
by the parents. By June 24th the hen was again sitting on five eggs ; these
hatched on the 7th and 8th Jul}^ ; two of these died young but the three others
left the nest on July 23rd and were successfully reared. In the following year
the same pair built in a basket hung in the same holly-bush : incubation com-
menced about June loth ; of the four eggs laid, two were hatched on the 24th, and
the young left the nest on July loth, and were successfully reared.
It is best to rear this species from the nest; for then it is supposed to become
very tame and confiding ; my brief experience of the bird, caught when quite
young, aud given to me on the 12th August, 1896, is that it is as wild as any adult
bird, and cuts itself all to pieces in its incessant efforts to force its way through the
wires of its prison ; from the nature of its food its cage needs constant cleaning,
otherwise it .smells abominably ; its note of rage, char, char, is frequently uttered, but
nothing else. As it will not now learn its natural song, a few good performers
such as the Nightingale, Blackcap, Skylark, Grey Singing-finch, or the Pekin Night-
ingale, should be kept in cages near by; in order that it may study their notes.
The Spotted Flycatctier rarely reaches us before May ; but, nevertheless is in
no hurry to go to nest ; the earliest date at which I have taken its eggs was on
the 30th of that month, and they are rarely obtained before June.
As proof that birds are sometimes unable to recognize their own eggs, the
following fact (already recorded in my Handbook of British Oology) is of interest :
On the 4th June, 1S78, I removed three eggs from a rather small nest of the
Spotted Flycatcher formed in the hollow top of a tree stump in a small plantation
of hazels. I substituted three hazel-nuts for the eggs, and these completely filled
the cavity of the nest. On the 8th of June I returned and found the hen sitting:
she had ejected one of the hazel-nuts to make room for a fourth egg-
Respecting the notes of this species, Seebohm sa3'S : - "It is very widely and
popularly believed that the Spotted Flycatcher is not gifted with any powers of
song ; but this is an error. His song is heard but rarely, it is true, and is uttered
in such a low tone as to be scarcely heard a few yards awa}'. It is given forth
both when the bird is sitting at rest and when fluttering in the air after insects.
It consists of a few rambling notes, not unlike part of the Whinchat's song. The
monotonous call-note may perhaps be best expressed by the letters cf, zt ; it is
uttered in rapid succession from one perching-place, and every now and then the
tail is jerked to and fro with graceful motion. Sometimes a second syllable is
added to the call-note, which then sounds like zt-chick.'"
I think that Seebohm is incorrect in this last statement: in 1894 I had a
family of young Spotted Flycatchers in my garden for over a week, and I found
that their call to their parents was zt-chick, and the answer of the parents was sf.
I never heard an adult bird use the longer call.
The food of the Spotted Flycatcher in the summer months consists of insects,
spiders, and centipedes, but in the autumn it is said to eat the berries of the
mountain-ash ; much of its food is obtained on the wing, either by repeated sallies
into the air, by hawking low down over the meadows, or hovering in front of old
walls, or manure heaps.
As this species rarely has eggs before the beginning of June, and usually
leaves this country in September, it is not surprising that it is single brooded.
Mr. Gumey's experience of the perseverance with which this species adheres
to a building site was published many years since in the "Zoologist" ; but never-
theless is sufficiently interesting to bear repeating here ; he says : - " About the
end of June last, a Spotted Flycatcher began to build a nest over the door of the
lodge at the entrance of my grounds. The woman who lives in the lodge, not
wishing the bird to build there, destro3'ed the commencement of the nest ; every
day for a week the bird placed new materials on the same ledge over the door,

The Shore- Lark.
Olocurvs alpcstris, LiNX.
BREEDS within the Arctic Circle bej'ond the limits of forest- growth in
the northern portions of the Old and New Worlds ; on migration it
occurs throughout the greater part of Europe, though hitherto not recorded
from Spain and Portugal ; eastward it is met with in Turkestan, S. Siberia, and
N. China.
To Great Britain this bird was at one time only an irregular visitor, but
since the winter of 1869-70 when there was a considerable immigration to our
eastern coasts, its appearance in autumn and winter has been regular ; according
to Mr. Aplin, specimens have visited us on the northward migration in spring as
late as April 22nd. On the eastern coast of Scotland it has been met with as
far north as St Andrews. In 1906 a few visited Fair Isle (Shetlands), from
October to December.
The adult male of the Shore-Lark has the forehead, a stripe partly en-
closing the eye and ear-coverts, and extending over the sides of neck, and uniting
with a patch over the chin and fore-throat creamy-white ; the front of the crown
and an erectile tuft on each side of the crown, the lores, cheeks, and a belt across
the lower throat and breast, black ; ear-coverts creamy, tipped with brown ; nape,
mantle, lesser wing-coverts, and upper tail-coverts vinaceous-brown ; wing-coverts
tipped with white ; quills smoky-brown, the first primary white externally, the
others with ashy-margins ; feathers of the back greyish-brown with black centres
to the feathers ; two central tail-feathers coloured like those of the back, the
remainder black, the outer feather with white margin to the outer web ; remainder
of under parts creamy- white, becoming vinous on the breast, flanks, and thighs;
flanks streaked with brown ; bill and feet black ; iris deep brown. The female
is smaller, duller, with less black and no erectile tufts on the head, but with dark
centres to all the feathers of the upper parts. Young males resemble the winter
plumage of the female, but young females show no yellow on the forehead and
have black bases to the feathers of the crown. After the autumn moult adult
birds have yellow margins to the feathers on the head and nape.
may have escaped from some ship passing our shores, or (soon after importation)
from an aviary.*
This bird, sometimes called " Scarlet Grosbeak," is, superficially, in no respect
like a Bullfinch ; whereas in notes, form of beak, outline of body, and behaviour,
it approaches the Serins. After its first moult in captivity the male loses all its
rosy colouring, just as the Crossbill does.

DR. SHARPE gives the geographical distribution of this species as : -
" Central and Southern Europe, ranging eastwards to Asia Minor, Palestine,
and Egypt : and northwards to Northern Germany, Denmark, and occasion-
ally the British Islands."
Although there is no absolute proof that the few specimens of this species
which have been obtained in Great Britain may not all have escaped from con-
finement, the Serin being a well-known and tolerably freely imported cage-bird ;
the fact that it breeds in the Netherlands, renders it quite possible, and even
probable, that they ma}' have been stragglers to our coasts. Seebohm observes : -
"It is said that a Serin was caught near Portsmouth, in April, 1852, another at
Taunton, in 1866, and a third at Worthing, in 1869; but by far the greater
number are those brought by the Brighton bird-catchers to Mr. Swaj'sland. Rarely

The Martin.
CInlidon urbica, LiXN.
THE House-Martin breeds througliout Europe, ranging even further north than
the Swallow. Seebohm sa3's of it : - " It occasionally straggles to the Canaries
and Madeira, and breeds abundantly in North-west Africa. In Egypt and
Nubia it is only known on migration ; but it breeds in Palestine, Asia Minor,
and Persia. Scarcely anything is known of its winter quarters, which probably
are somewhere in Central Africa. A few birds are supposed to winter in Algeria,
and stragglers are said to occur in Turkestan and India."
Generally distributed throughout Great Britain, with the exception of the
Outer Hebrides.
The adult Martin has the upper parts to the rump glossy blue-black ; the
rump, inner tail-coverts, and under parts pure white ; wings and tail brownish-
spot, and before I had seen any other description of it, recall the song to my
memory - the short notes at the beginning, the rather fragmentary and hesitating
character of the strain, and the little coda or iiuish, which reminded me of the
Chaffinch, but all this will have no meaning to nij^ readers. There is but one
way of learning a bird's song, and that is by listening to it in solitude again and
again, until you have associated it in your mind, with the form, and habits, and
haunts of the singer."
Gatke states that the Pied Flycatcher " visits Heligoland in larger numbers
than any of its near relatives. It is especially abundant during the autumn
migration, returning from its nesting quarters as early as the beginning of August,
if the weather is fine and warm, and the wind from the south or south-east."
"Why this bird should migrate before scarcity of food or cold compel it to do so,
it is difficult to imderstand ; probably the tendency has been inherited, and points
back to some remote period when the summers of Kurope were of short duration.
The food of this species consists largely of insects, but it rarely, if ever,
pursues them in the air like the Spotted Flycatcher, preferring to watch from the
end of a branch, and pounce suddenly down upon them ; it is not, therefore, sur-
prising that among the pellets of undigested matter ejected by this, as by other
insectivorous birds, wing-cases of small beetles predominate ; it is, however, said
to pick flies and gnats from leaves upon which they have settled, and to eat worms.
Later in the year, as currants, raspberries, elderberries, etc., become ripe, the Pied
Flycatcher is said to add them to its dietary.
Far more beautiful than its Spotted relative, and with a much better idea of
music, it is no wonder that, where opportunity offers, this species is prized as a
cage-bird ; yet I have never seen one exhibited in England ; though in Germany
the Pied Flycatcher has put in an appearance at the exhibitions of the "Ornis"
Society. Being so much more local in Great Britain than the Spotted Flycatcher,
this species is much less frequently obtained at the right age for hand-rearing :
when once obtained, however, Swaysland assures us that it is far more easy to
keep than the commoner species, and may be turned either into cage or aviary,
and fed in the same w'Siy as Warblers, or as the Nightingale. Doubtless the food
recommended for M. grisola by Mr. Louis Bonhote (Avicultural Magazine, Vol. I,
p. 58) would answer equally well for this species; he says: - "In captivity, they
should be fed on ants' eggs, and hard-boiled eggs, mixed in equal parts, and as
many mealworms as their keeper can afford to give them. They become very tame,
and will rise in the air and catch mealworms as they are thrown to them. In
catching a mealworm, they leave the perch and hover in the air, waiting for the
mealworm to drop, and catch it as it passes them ; if they should miss it, they

OCCURS iu Western Europe, aud probably breeds iu some of the mountains
of the South-West ; one nest having been obtained from the Veglio Alps,
in Italy, about 7,000 feet above the sea-level.
Iu Great Britain this Redpoll is resident, breeding most freely in the north
of England and Ireland, aud iu well-timbered localities in Scotland, more particu-
larly iu plantations of birch. This bird is, however, by no meaus restricted to
the north of England, or Ireland, during the breeding-season ; its nest having
been found in most of the southern counties to the east of Somerset, in the north
of which county it has also bred : in Kent, I believe, it breeds regularly, though
not abundantl}', every j-ear.*
The upper surface, of the adult male in breeding-plumage is ruddy olive-

darker brown, with pale margins ; innermost secondaries broadly margined; median

rump washed with rosy-red ; lores and centre of throat black ; sides of head and
throat golden olive-brown ; breast rose-red ; sides and flanks golden olive-brown,

The food of this bird is exactly similar to that of the Sky- Lark, consisting
chiefly of insects in summer, and seeds in winter.
The Wood-Lark's song is ver^' pnre and melodious and b}- man}^ it is con-
sidered only second to that of the Nightingale, but it certaiul}' is not so full
of variety as the song of that bird ; nevertheless it has the merit of being
persevered in throughout the year, excepting during the moulting season ; it
is usually commenced, and sometimes completed, from the branch of a tree ;
but more frequently the tree only represents the point at which the flight-song
begins : the last time that I heard the flute-like music of this bird at liberty, I was
down at Dover with mj- old friend Dr. John Grayling, of Sittiugbourne ; we were
approaching a wood when, from a tree at the side of the road, we heard the
delightful song of a Wood-Lark ; looking up we soon espied him on a branch
and were able to identify him without difficulty by his short tail and promineut
eye-streak. Presently he soared awaj^ rising at first obliquely and then gradually
swinging round, still singing, aud rising until he had reached the height of his
ambition, when with wide spiral curves he descended to the earth. The Wood-
Lark is said sometimes to sing throughout the night, and it certainlj? does sing
well into the " gloaming," which has led rustics at times to confound it with the
Nightingale ; but, by careless observers, it is much more generally confused with
the Tree- Pipit.
Although this bird sometimes soars quite as high as the Sky-Lark this is
not its general habit ; moreover it flies more in circles and descends to the
earth in a wide spiral, instead of obliquely or b}' jerky drops.
As a cage-bird, the Wood-Lark is a great favourite, and I have possessed
two adult specimens. On one occasion when driving through a country
road in Kent, with woods on either side, a young bird was seen scampering
and leaping to get out of our way. The driver pulled up and succeeded in
catching it for me; but although it soon fed itself and to repletion, it quickly
got cramp and died. Later on, in June 1887, my son aud I caught sight of
a slightly older example of this species in a somewhat similar situation and
exerted ourselves to catch it, but it made for a tall hawthorn hedge, up which
it escaped with such rapidity, that before we could come up with it, the bird
was out of our reach. About September, 1894, I was beautifully taken in by an
unprincipled bird-catcher : he had told me of a lovely Wood-Lark which he had,
and which he described as singing splendidly. One dark night he knocked at my
front door and told me he had brought this bird, which I could have for three
shillings. I put my hand through the opening at the top of the cage, and took
the bird out ; it had a short tail, but (even in the dark) looked somewhat uncann}' ;
uote -wliicli the late Mr. Witcliell renders tell, must be that which souuds to me
like c/iov.1.
This species is of no interest as a cage-bird, unless hand-reared : a caught
Sparrow rarel}^ lives long, is always wild, vicious, voracious, and unmusical ; if
haud-reared it has been known to learn and sing the sougs of the Goldfinch,
Linnet, Canary, and Skylark. A friend of mine had one which imitated the
Canary's song perfectly, but seemed ashamed of its performance, for it always
turned its face to the wall and sang quite softly ; it also never sang until the
evening when the Canaries had gone to sleep. For feeding caged Sparrows I
should recommend sunflower-seed, oats, Canar}', and German-rape ; groundsel- and
plantain-heads ; with a few insects and their larvae.
Albinism seems to be on the increase in this species, and more particularly
in Loudon ; where, if one examines each flock that one passes in a half-hour's
walk through the streets, it is not at all unusual to see several pied varieties :
there are always two or three among those which collect for crumbs in front of
the Natural History Museum.

The Tree-Sparrow.
Passer nioiitanus, LiNN.
SEEBOHM gives the distribution of this bird as follows: - "The Tree-Sparrow
is common, though somewhat local, throughout the Palsearctic Region from
the Atlantic to the Pacific up to and, in Europe, slightly beyond the Arctic
circle. It appears to be very rare in North Africa, and to be absent altogether
from Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine, Central and Southern Persia, Baluchistan,
and India south of the Himalayas ; it is, however, abundant in Turkestan,
may also be often seen, though at times wheu it sits upon a flowering furze-bush
it is overlooked until its ringing song directs one's attention to the performer.
The song of the Yellow Bunting is not especially meritorious, though bright
and cheering; it consists of a rapid descending scale made up of a repetition ni
a sharp note which may be rendered chip or cliink\ and terminating with a double
note cluc-chee : it rather suggests the shaking up of shillings between the hands,
and has been likened to the words "Give me a little bit of bread and no cheese,"
though "green cheese" would have been a better interpretation: occasionally the
double note is omitted ; but more especially when the bird is beginning to sing
in the early spring. Being a late breeder this species continues his song well
into the autumn, and often recommences in February. The male call-note is
described as (Inch, cliicli, churr.
The nidification of this bird commences about the middle of April, and not
unfrequently continues up to the end of August : I have myself taken a nest as
late as the 12th August with three fresh eggs (Vide "Zoologist" for December,
1883) and eggs have been obtained in September.
Tlie nest is usually placed low dowm, though occasionally at a distance of from
four to five feet above the ground in a hedge, and (according to Howard Saunders)
exceptionally at a height of seven feet. I have often found it in low bushes, but
only once in furze ; in low scrub on partially cleared waste ground ; in holes in
grassy banks by the road-side ; or under a low dividing hedge between fields ; also
at a considerable height (from thirty to forty feet) in a niche in the side of a
gravel or chalk-pit surrounded by tufts of plantain and grass. The structure is a
loose one, occasionally so much so that, when taken, the outer walls have to be
supported to prevent their falling apart ; these consist of coarse straws, dead
grasses, and sometimes a few twigs interlaced ; and, in one nest which I took
from a hedge, there was an edging of dead chestnut leaves ; the lining consists of
fine withered grass-bents, and a few rootlets and horsehairs.
The eggs of the Yellow Hammer are extremely variable, both in ground-tint
and marking, although most of them exhibit the purplish-black characters which
have earned for this bird the title of " Scribbling Lark." In tint they vary from
greenish-white, through greyish-lavender, to pale rosy-brownish ; whilst one o^g^,
taken by my brother Frank, in Cornwall, was bright sieuua-red, with a single
irregular blackish line across one side, and somewhat resembles a rare form of
the egg of the Tree-Pipit (Plate HI, fig. 100). On two occasions I have taken
the greenish-white egg almost or entirely without markings, the first time I only
secured the first egg (as I had to return to town the following day) on the second
occasion I obtained a clutch of three ; four elliptical eggs in one clutch were dull
warm mass. The nest is most freqiieutl}' placed in hawthorn hedges, where
mimicry of its environment wonld be absolutely useless ; preference is given to
hedges enclosing orchards, but roadside hedge-rows are often utilized, as also those
along the margins of woods ; the forks of young fruit-trees and the boughs of
old apple-trees are sometimes selected as nesting-sites, and Seebohm speaks of the
" lichen- and moss-covered branches of the birch- and ash-trees, far up in the
towering branches of the oak, the alder, and the poplar, and on the lowly branches
of the holly, more rarely of the yew, and freciuentl}- in the gorse shrubs." I
have found it in the yew, but never in gorse.
The nest takes from five da^-s to a fortnight to construct, all depending upon
whether the bird is ready to la^'. In form it is a small neat cup, slightl}' con-
tracted at the top, and tolerably deep ; but curiously enough Seebohm quotes a
note h\ a Mr. C. Doncaster on a very aberrant nest seen by him on a thorn tree
by the river Derweut, which appears to have been like that made by an English
Chaffinch sent to New Zealand, and which has been figured b}' Dixon as evidence
that birds do not inherit the design upon which they construct their nests. In the
year 1896 I again turned a Canarj- loose in an aviary, and had the pleasure of
seeing her prove the fallacy of Dixon's belief, by building a cup-shaped nest in a
bunch of fir-twigs, her only pattern being set b}- a Canary on the opposite side
of the aviary sitting in the usual square box.
The materials of the nest, as already stated, vary a good deal; the normal t\pe
being firmly felted together and formed of moss, a few lichens and spiders' cocoons,
and lined with rootlets and hair, intermingled, or covered, with a la3'er of thistle-
down ; but one of my nests has a rather rough aspect, being constructed of roots
and fibre, mingled with fine worsted, and with hardl}- any moss or lichen in the
outer walls, but with the usual lining ; others have feathers mixed with the usual
materials in the lining. The eggs, four to six in number, are, as a rule, either
greenish, or rosy flesh-coloured, the markings consisting of diffused sienna or ruddy
brownish patches and streaks, some of which enclose blots, commas, dots, streaks,
or hair-lines of blackish-brown ; in some eggs the reddish markings are chiefly
massed over the larger end : in others the darker markings form a subterminal
zone, whilst in rare instances they are wholly absent, the eggs being bluish, slightly
clouded with I'eddish : the rarest t3'pe, of which I have only taken two clutches, is
exactly like some eggs of the Bullfinch, clear blue, with grey shell-spots, purplish
patches, and almost black surface spots. The Chaffinch certainl}- frequently rears
three broods in a year ; nidification lasting from April sometimes to August.
The natural food of the Chaffinch in summer, as already stated, consists largely
of insects, their larvae, spiders, and the soft foliage and unripe seeds of weeds ; but at
occasiou I called upon them to try aud obtain a cock bird for breeding purposes;
and, seeing that they had paired a Greenfinch and hen Canary in one of their
cages, I asked whj- they were trying to breed such ugly unremuuerative mules.
They replied that their stock was getting weak, and they always introduced Green-
finch blood when their birds were falling off in vigour, aud then bred out the
taint, pairing the mules with Canaries. This has been supposed an impossibility;
yet it was spoken of as a matter of course. Since then other mules, said to have
been bred from hybrids, paired with either parent stock, have been exhibited at
the Crystal Palace.

The Hawfinch.
Coccotliraustcs vulgaris, PallAS.
This extremely ungainly bird is distributed over nearly the whole of Europe;
breeding in Russia as far northwards as St. Petersburg, but only visiting
Scandinavia in the winter ; its range extends eastwards to Asia Minor,
and the Caucasus, and possibly to Northern Persia and Turkestan. On the
African Continent a few examples breed in Algeria, and the species has been
known to straggle as far northward as Egypt.
In Great Britain the Hawfinch is local, but according to the late Howard
Saunders has been increasing in numbers for the past Aft}' 3-ears ; he attributes
this fact to the increase of market-gardens. Formerly it was rare in Wales and
the extreme western counties from Cornwall to Cumberland ; but breeding in suitable
localities in most of the counties of England and in Ireland. To Scotland it is
still chiefly an accidental winter visitant, though one nest was obtained in 1903
near Newport, in the east of Fifesliire.
Although the form of the Hawfinch is anything but graceful, its colouring is
