production with the original, and discover that you are wide of the mark: there
is absolutely no resemblance between the dream and the reality.
About 1891 a pair of Ortolan Buntings was given to me by Mr. P. J. Lowrey;
and, judging (from my experience of Yellow Hammers and Reed Buntings in
captivity) that this species would be equally inoffensive, I turned them out into a
large covered aviary with English Finches, and many small Ploceine Finches. At
first the Ortolans were quiet enough, their feathers being somewhat abraded (owing
to the fact that they had been kept in a cage in some small bird-shop): no sooner
however, had these birds moulted and thus recovered their full power of flight,
than they occupied themselves for the greater part of each day in chasing the
unfortunate Waxbills and Mannikins all over the aviary. Apparently, the Ortolans
had no vicious intentions in the pursuit of their weaker associates; they never
actually pecked them, when they had an opportunity of doing so; but they could
not resist the pleasure which the frantic terror of the little Finches evidently gave
them: they darted up and down the aviary almost with the rapidity of a Swallow,
whilst the poor little hunted birds, unable to escape by mere speed, were forced
to fling themselves against the wirework and double back to avoid their pursuers.
Seeing that it was impossible to keep Ortolans in an aviary containing
Ornamental Finches, I now captured my birds and placed them in another aviary
with Redwings, Greenfinches, Chaffinches, &c., here they suddenly dropped all the
active habits which had previously characterized them, becoming as dull and
listless as other members of their genus: their health, nevertheless, was always
perfect, and their plumage tight and glossy. I parted with this pair at the same
time as I sold my Redwings, and subsequently they were made use of for show
purposes.
In the late autumn of 1894 I selected a male Ortolan from a consignment of
Weavers (out of colour) which had just been received from Africa: it had been
imported, together with Abyssinian and Russ' Weavers, and with these I kept it
in one of my cool aviaries.
Like its predecessors, this Ortolan, associated as it was with naturally quarrel-
some and powerful birds, was singularly quiet and retiring in its demeanour; indeed
it often seemed to weary of the constant wranglings and strong language of the
Weavers, and perched quite low down, or even on the earth; where, from time to
time, it uttered its melancholy little monotonous song: although it never had a
chance of securing any insect food, all of which was greedily devoured as soon as
it was thrown into the aviary by three specimens of a Cape Weaver Sitagra (S.
capensis ?) it appeared to find all that it needed for its health in the few dried ants'
cocoons remaining in a saucer of soft food, which had already been picked over
with the House-Sparrow." It would, therefore, appear that, if properly treated,
this species does become steady enough to breed in confinement.
I have been told, by Aviculturists who have kept the Tree-Sparrow, that it
is not tyrannical in an aviary; it must, however, be borne in mind, that an indi-
vidual does not necessarily exhibit the characteristics of a species; even half a
dozen specimens may all be of a peaceful disposition (as was the case with my
Robins, which never fought with any but their own species). On the other hand
one vicious Tree-Sparrow, associated with birds weaker than itself, might do much
mischief in a very short space of time: its powerful beak would enable it to kill
or maim any smaller or weaker bird without the least trouble.
Family-FRINGILLIDÆ.

THE CHAFFINCH.
Fringilla cælebs, LINN.
ALTHOUGH the type of the family Fringillidæ and, therefore, the Finch of
Finches, this species and the Brambling differ much in their habits from
the other British species of typical Finches (Fringillinæ) and one is
surprised that any man, having the knowledge of living birds which Seebohm
undoubtedly had, should have been content to place forms with Tit-like habits
(Siskin, Goldfinch, Redpolls) in the same genus with the true species of Fringilla
-birds which have the habits of Buntings. If distinctive structural characters
were wholly absent, one could understand it.
The Chaffinch is distributed as a breeding species throughout Europe almost
up to the North Cape, but in the south of Europe it chiefly haunts the mountains
during the breeding season, wintering in the plains. It occurs locally in Morocco
and Algeria, and winters in Egypt. In Asia it is said to breed in Palestine, Asia
Minor, and Western Persia, and to winter in Turkestan.
In Great Britain the Chaffinch is generally distributed; breeding freely in all
building like them (sic), but by holes in the outside"; whilst Howard Saunders
mentions its building "beneath the tiles of roofs, as well as under the coping of
old walls and in sea-cliffs"; I have taken it from a hole in a ruined lime-kiln;
and, in the "Zoologist" for 1887, p. 265, I recorded the fact of my finding a
nest with six perfectly typical eggs (on May 24th) in an exposed mole-burrow in
a brick-earth cutting at Kemsley, near Sheppy. Nidification lasts from May to
August, nests being most abundant in the latter half of May.
The nest is usually bag-shaped, consisting of a mere thick lining to the hole
in which it is situated; the top being widely open, so that the light generally
falls directly upon the eggs; the materials are similar to those used by the
Common Sparrow-straw, hay, and a mass of poultry-feathers. The eggs number
from four to six; they are rather smaller than those of the House-Sparrow, and
vary nearly as much (perhaps quite as much, if one could obtain a sufficient series
to decide the point); I have taken them greenish-white, with scarcely perceptible
grey speckling; greenish-white, speckled with grey, spotted with two shades of
sepia, sometimes with the heaviest markings in a subterminal zone; somewhat
greyer, mottled and streaked with grey (not unlike an egg of the Pied Wagtail);
greyish-white, thickly mottled and blotched with grey, most densely at the larger
end, also with one or two blackish dots (not unlike a Titlark's egg); dull white,
heavily blotched and streaked with vandyke-brown in two shades, and with small
grey shell-spots; similar, but so densely streaked and splashed with brown as
almost to hide the ground-colour; lastly rufous-brown, speckled and streaked,
especially at the larger end, with darker brown (resembling a reddish variety of
the Tree-Pipit). The darker and more ruddy eggs are most characteristic of the
species; but most of those which I obtained from Kentish nests were of the lighter
varieties, though the eggs in one clutch sometimes exhibit considerable modification
in this respect. It is possible that the colouring of the eggs may have a local
significance, inasmuch as Lord Lilford's experience in Northamptonshire led him
to the conclusion that the ground-colour, as a rule, was lighter than in eggs of
the House-Sparrow; whilst those which I obtained in Norfolk were usually
remarkable for their darker ground-tint, although exceptions did occur.
It seems to me more probable that light in some way affects the colouring of
eggs; inasmuch as, not only are most eggs which are laid in the dark pure white,
but all those which I have found in heavily shaded positions have been pale and
little marked, in comparison with those exposed to direct daylight; the lightest
eggs of the Tree-Sparrow which I obtained in Norfolk were those taken from the
horizontal branch of a willow, where the light only entered imperfectly over one
side of the nest-cavity; those in the top of the stump, which were fully exposed
after I had taken the first clutch: these eggs are more heavily marked than any
which I have obtained elsewhere.
The Swallow is an admirable singer, and I shall not easily forget the pleasure
with which I first heard it, as it poured forth its sweet melody from the girders
of a large railway-station in Switzerland, in 1869; I have heard it several times
since, both in Kent and Norfolk, singing from a telegraph wire: the song is very
varied and, to my mind, far more melodious than that of a Linnet. Its call may
be heard as it chases its insect prey-hwit, hwit, or as it greets a passing comrade,
hwit-tit-tit-tit.
The food of the Swallow consists largely of gnats, small flies, and ephemeræ;
but it frequently settles on the roads, or on manure heaps, to search for small
dung-beetles: owing to its short legs, its progression on the earth is somewhat
awkward, and when hurried it uses its wings to help it along: it usually drinks
on the wing, skimming the surface of the water as it glides over: its rapid graceful
flight is too well known to need description, sometimes at such an elevation that
the eye can scarcely follow it, sometimes so near the earth that the grasses wave
under the rush of its outspread wings.
As a cage-bird the Swallow is a mistake; he sits upon his perch all day
looking miserable, rarely moving excepting to eat or drink: specimens have been
exhibited at the Crystal Palace shows, held in 1889, 1890, 1891, 1893, and 1896:
in one case the bird was awarded a prize, although it only had one perfect wing;
as a rule the staple food placed in the cage for the consumption of these unhappy
captives consisted of gentles.
So far as I can judge, the object of the owners of caged Swallows is, not to
make their pets happy, but to rush them from one show to another, in the hope
of gaining many awards before their prisoner dies; one of the unfortunates was
described as "Winner of 23 First, and 11 Special Prizes"-Poor Swallow!
At the London Zoological Gardens the Swallow has been kept in a large
aviary, where it seemed to be perfectly happy.
(especially when built over water); deserted nesting-holes of Woodpeckers or Tits
are sometimes utilized : it haunts groves of oak, beech, aspen, or chestnut, in
preference to dense wood; although, according to Dixon, it may sometimes be met
with in the latter situation. Lord Lilford says that "the nest is generally situated
in the hole of a pollard willow, or other tree, often in an old wall; in fact, very
much in the sort of locality that we should look for a nest of the Common Red-
start."
The nest is somewhat loosely constructed of dry bents, rootlets, and a little
moss; the lining being formed of wool, feathers, and sometimes hair. The eggs
vary in number from four to eight, five to six being usual. As Lord Lilford
observes "Yarrell records an instance of eight in a nest, but, from my acquaintance
with this species in Spain, I should cousider that number as very exceptional."
The colouring is always a very pale blue and unspotted, there is a slight variation
in depth of tint, but otherwise the only modifications in the eggs of this bird are
in size and outline, depending much upon the age and condition of health of the
parent bird.
W. Warde Fowler in his charming "Summer Studies of Birds and Books,"
gives a most delightful account of the Pied Flycatcher, which is well worth quoting
in full, if only space would permit; but I must content myself with an extract :-
" On the Continent I have always seen him in just such places as he loves in
Wales, among the larger timber of a Swiss mountain-side, or on the forest slopes
of the Taunus range. Just as the trout loves swiftly-running streams, or as the
Wood-wren is sure to be heard where the oak is the prevailing tree, so there are
certain spots which you instinctively feel that this bird ought to have chosen for
his habitation, and if you are in the right district you may fairly lay a wager
that he will be found there. Such a spot, on the edge of the beech forests of
Wiesbaden, will always remain in very clear outline in my memory, for it was
there I first heard the song of this bird. It is very seldom now that I hear a
song that is quite new to me. If it were not that so many of our songsters sing
all too short a time, and that when they tune up one by one for the orchestra of
the spring season each instrument touches the ear with the fresh delight of recog-
nition, I might feel as much at the end of my tether as the mountaineer who has
no more peaks to climb. But this song was not only new, but wonderfully sweet
and striking. 'Something like a Redstart's' say the books, and this is not untrue,
so far as it represents the outward form, so to speak, of the song-the quickness
or shortness of notes, the rapid variations of pitch. But no one who has once
accustomed his ear to the very peculiar timbre of the voice of either kind of Red-
start will mistake for it the song of the Pied Flycatcher. My notes, taken on the
horn-brown; iris hazel. The female differs somewhat as in the Sky-Lark; the
wing being decidedly shorter in this sex than in the male. Young birds are more
rufous above, the feathers tipped with buff; below they are more yellow and much
more freely spotted with black than in adults.
On account of the different character of the nostrils (in this species) which
are half exposed and overhung by an operculum, Dr. Sharpe and others have
separated it as a distinct genus-Lullula, Kaup, doubtless suggested by the French
"Lu-lu," a name given as an indication of its flute-like notes.
Col. L. H. I. Irby, in his "Ornithology of the Straits of Gibraltar," says
that "on the Andalucian side the Wood-Lark is sparingly and locally distributed
during the winter months up to as late as the 21st of April, frequenting scrub
where not very thick, a favourite locality near Gibraltar being the Chaparales
(ground covered with brushwood) in the Cork-wood. Well-known to the Spanish
bird-catchers, and highly valued as a cage-bird; they assured me that the Wood-
Lark never remains to nest near Gibraltar, but they are known to breed near
Malaga."
The Wood-Lark is only to be found in timbered country; not that it confines
itself strictly to the immediate neighbourhood of woods, or clearings in plantations,
parks, and groves, although these are its favourite resorts; for it also frequents
commons; but trees appear to be necessary to its happiness, and where these do
not exist it will not be met with.
Although very fond of perching on the branches of trees, the Wood-Lark feeds
principally on the ground, where it also roosts and builds its nest. The latter is
placed in a depression in the earth, sometimes under a grass-tussock or small
bush; it is more compactly built than that of the Sky-Lark; sometimes
of couch-grass and a little moss, with finer grass and a little hair for a lining;
sometimes wholly of grass bents, the finer ones forming the lining. The eggs,
which in this country are often deposited by the middle of March, are apparently
not laid in Central Spain until the beginning of May (Lilford) or in the Parnassus
until the third week in that month (Seebohm): they number from four to five, and
are buffish- or greenish-white, spotted with reddish-brown, or brownish-lilac, and
with underlying greyer spots: as with the allied species they may either be evenly
distributed over the entire surface, or more densely massed at the extremities, or
in a zone near the larger end; as a rule, however, the spots are smaller and less
confluent than in eggs of the Sky-Lark, those of the Wood-Lark being generally
admitted to more nearly resemble some varieties of those of the Crested Lark.
The Wood-Lark is double-brooded, and I have never been out of town quite early
enough for the first brood.
and every day the woman removed them, and, at the end of the week, placed a
stone on the ledge, which effectually baffled the Flycatcher's efforts at that spot;
but the bird then began building at the latter end of the ledge, from whence it
was also driven, and three stones being then placed on the ledge, the bird relin-
quished the attempt to build at either end of it, and commenced building a nest
on a beech-tree opposite, which it completed, and laid two eggs in it. When the
bird was thus apparently established in the beech-tree, the stones over the door
were taken away, when the Flycatcher immediately forsook its nest and eggs in
the beech, and again commenced building over the door on the part of the pro-
jecting ledge, which it had first chosen. The nest was again destroyed, and two
slates placed over the spot; the bird contrived to throw down one of the slates
from a slanting to a horizontal position, and then began to build upon it. The
nest was again destroyed, and the three stones replaced and kept there a fortnight,
after which they were again removed, and, directly they were taken away, the bird
again began building. The nest was subsequently destroyed several times in
succession; the bird was twice driven away by a towel being thrown at it; a stone
wrapped in white paper was placed on the ledge to intimidate it, but the Flycatcher
still persevered, completed a nest, and laid an egg. On hearing the circumstances
I directed that the persecution of the poor bird should cease, after which it laid
two more eggs, hatched all three, and successfully brought off its brood."
Some years since a young Spotted Flycatcher was brought to me; it had
flown against a lamp, was temporarily stunned, and a lad picked it up without
difficulty. I tried to keep it, but it refused to feed, as most birds do after they
have left the nest, and, although I forced it to eat, it died the next day: perhaps
I lost nothing by the death of this bird; for the Flycatchers are not especially
suited to cage or aviary life, are neither attractive in plumage or song, and are
said to be delicate and difficult to keep in health. If reared from the nest they
would doubtless eat the usual soft food, but I should expect them to follow the
example of the Hirundinidæ, eat to repletion and take little exercise. They have
been kept, but it may be questioned whether it is worth the trouble.*

and primaries. Hitherto I have kept the birds together in the hope that the
Buzzard might recover his lost courage, but I have now arranged to separate
them, as I am afraid of the Buzzard being permanently injured." The remainder
of Mr. Comyns' notes are more in accordance with general experience, and there-
fore, of less interest.
Mr. Frohawk saw seven examples of this species at the mouth of the Avon
(S. Devon) at the end of September, 1895; they all kept together and may
perhaps have been the old and young of the same family.
Family-CORVIDÆ.
THE CARRION-CROW.
Corvus corone, LINN.
IN Siberia, according to Seebohm, this species occupies the forest country
lying between Yenesay and the Pacific coast, extending northwards in
summer almost to the limits of forest growth and south-eastwards to Japan.
Westwards he is of opinion that, following the mountain-ranges of southern
Siberia into Turkestan, it crossed the Caspian, passed through an equally large
colony of Hooded Crows by way of the Caucasus, the northern shores of the
Black Sea and the valley of the Danube and keeping to the north of the Alps
spread over Germany, the Netherlands, the British Isles, France and Spain. He
was able also to prove that this species interbreeds with the Hooded Crow in the
valleys of the Elbe and Yenesay (as it is known to do in Scotland) producing
many intergrades between the two species, examples of which he presented to
the Trustees of the British Museum; these have been carefully mounted, and
form one of the most instructive and attractive cases in the entrance-hall of the
Natural History branch of that Museum at South Kensington.
combined attack, otherwise the young chicks of pheasants and partridges would
indeed fare badly. Lord Lilford observes:-" We have not a word to say in
defence of the Carrion-Crow. His habits appear to us to be purely noxious, and
neither his personal appearance, voice, or manners in captivity offers anything in
extenuation of his natural evil propensities."
The flight of the Carrion-Crow is somewhat laboured, though at times very
rapid, its wings regularly beating the air; when approaching the earth it usually
wheels round in circles. On the earth it either walks, or, if in a hurry, leaps
forward with half opened wings after the fashion of its kind.
The time of nidification of the Carrion-Crow is from the latter half of April
to nearly the end of May (a clutch which I purchased from a shepherd, whose
boys had just taken them from a nest near the top of an elm-tree at Iwade near
Sheppy, consisted of three full-sized eggs and one small yolkless one, all of which
were quite fresh on May 25th). The nest is bulky and the same structure is
believed to be used and added to year after year; it is either placed in a niche,
or on a ledge of rock, or in a tall tree,-oak, elm, or pine; but in Holland it is
said to be built upon the ground. J. B. Pilley, of Hereford ("Zoologist," 1891,
p. 352), records the discovery of a nest containing five eggs on the top of a tall
hedge, in some meadows near the city. The nest is somewhat flat and formed of
dead sticks, twigs, grass-tussocks and roots, with a lining of fur, wool, feathers
or other soft materials neatly smoothed down. The eggs number from four to
six, five being a frequent clutch, and are sometimes indistinguishable from those
of the Raven, but usually they are somewhat smaller; the ground-colour is bluish-
green and the markings which vary considerably in density consist of spots,
longitudinal streaks and blotches of olive and olive-brown; some of the markings
are frequently almost black and others almost grey. It is believed that this Crow
pairs for life.
Of the eggs of this species figured on our plate, figs. 233, 234 and 235 are
from Mr. Farn's collection, and 236 from that of Mr. Frohawk's; my own
specimens were not varied or characteristic enough to be worth representing.
The call is a hoarse croak, but some of the other cries of this species are
less objectionable. The food of this bird in summer consists of almost any kind
of animal too weak or sickly to defend itself, wounded sheep, helpless lambs, the
young of hares and rabbits, moles, young poultry, ducks, pheasants, partridges,
and grouse; but he does not confine himself entirely to this diet, he also feeds
on mollusca, which he extracts from the shells (as mentioned many years ago by
Messrs. Sheppard and Whitear) by carrying them up to a considerable height
and dropping them on to a stone; stale fish cast up by the waves, and carrion
In colouring the Chough is shining black, glossed with blue and purple; the
wings slightly greenish; the bill and feet are orange-vermilion; iris brown. The
female is a little smaller than the male. Young birds have the bill and feet dull
orange.
The haunts of the Chough are chiefly sea-side cliffs and rugged mountain
sides, and Dixon mentions that he observed a colony in Algeria "in a low ridge
of rocks, on the side of one of the barren stony valleys near the snow-capped
summit" of Djebel Mahmel. It is gregarious in its habits and appears to pair
for life. Its flight is somewhat characteristic; consisting largely, as Howard
Saunders says, of "a series of curves in the air, alternately rising with a scream,
and then suddenly dropping with almost closed wings"; its red bill is distinguish-
able at a considerable distance: on the earth it both walks and runs.
Seebohm renders the cry of the Chough as Khéé'-o, khéé'-o; but Howard
Saunders says-"The usual cry is a clear metallic 'Kling,' but in autumn I have
heard flocks uttering 'chough-chough' very plainly." The food consists of insects
and their larvæ, worms, probably mollusca, berries and grain.
The nest is usually situated in some wholly inaccessible hole or crevice, often
at some distance from the opening, in the face of an overhanging cliff or near
the roof of a cave; but sometimes in old castles, church-towers, or disused lime-
kilns; it is constructed of dry plant-stems, frequently of heather, and lined with
dead grass, rootlets, wool, and hair, or with some of these materials only. The
eggs, three to six in number, vary from dull creamy to greenish-white in ground-
colour, and are more or less boldly spotted and streaked with various shades of
brown and grey, some specimens having the markings pretty evenly distributed
over the entire surface, whilst others have them chiefly massed towards the larger
extremity.
Nidification generally commences late in April or early in May.
Many local names have been given to this bird, amongst which those of
Cornish Crow and Red-legged Crow are somewhat freely used; one of the names
Hermit Crow is hardly applicable to a bird which lives and breeds in colonies.
Seebohm says that the "Chough, like the Rook, leaves its roosting-place early
in the morning, and repairs to the neighbouring pastures in search of food, some-
times even being seen to follow the plough to pick up worms and grubs. It is
always a restless and a wary bird, never remaining long in one spot, but shifting
its ground in short uncertain flights."
It may be questioned whether this species ever attains a great age in confine-
ment, but it is very difficult to form any definite opinion, because of the apparent
carelessness with which exhibitors note the ages of birds: thus a Chough for many
Family-CORVIDÆ.
THE MAGPIE.
Pica rustica, SCOP.
BEAUTIFUL beyond all our other Crows, the Magpie unhappily has so many
enemies among game-preservers, that its numbers in some parts of Great
Britain have sadly diminished. Its distribution is most clearly defined by
Howard Saunders:-"From the North Cape in Scandinavia southward, it is found,
more or less plentifully throughout Europe, except in the islands of Corsica and
Sardinia; but it does not occur in Palestine, although found in Asia Minor.
Eastward-subject to a variation in the amount of white in the plumage, which
has led to the creation of several bad species-the Magpie is found across Asia
to India, China and Japan, and also in the northern portion of America from the
Pacific to Michigan."
In England, Wales and Scotland, this species is still fairly common and
widely distributed. In Ireland it is not only abundant, but its numbers are in-
creasing. Perhaps the comparative scarcity of this species at the present time in
some of the southern counties may be due almost as much to the wholesale de-
struction of timber, which has of late years been carried on by land-owners, as to
the undoubted enmity which game-keepers show to it. In a wood near Newington,
on the Chatham and Dover line, I have often seen several pairs both of this bird
and the Jay simultaneously flying up from their feeding-ground in a small-clearing;
but now that wood is converted into pasturage and hop-gardens: and the same
may be said of many a once grand hunting-ground for the Naturalist, for miles
and miles around that neighbourhood. Alas for Kent, once the garden of England!
it is rapidly becoming a mere dreary expanse of wire-fenced fields and hop-poles.
The Magpie is chiefly glossy black, showing purple and green reflections;
but the rump is whitish-grey; the scapulars white, the inner webs of the primaries
with a white patch; the tail with greenish-bronze and purple reflections, and with
a purplish-black subterminal band; abdomen snow-white: bill and feet black, iris
dark brown. Female slightly smaller and duller than the male, and with a
slightly shorter and heavier bill. Young birds somewhat duller than adults.
To see the full beauty of this grand bird on the wing, one must be behind
to the sky, were deepest in colouring; the nest containing an almost white egg
was from the ruined lime-kiln, and was almost as much in the dark as if it had
been taken from a Sand-Martin's burrow. Lord Lilford's eggs being taken from
holes in full-sized trees, and not from the tops of pollards, were probably but little
exposed to light.
The Tree-Sparrow is a more active sprightly bird than its commoner relative;
and, although it can hardly be said to have a song,* its chirruping is somewhat
more melodious, its chirp is sharper, and the indignant utterance of a recently
captured bird is shriller.
Although the Tree-Sparrow does not breed so continuously as the House-
Sparrow, which in mild seasons appears to rear family after family throughout the
greater part of the year, there is no doubt that it frequently produces three broods
in a season. When feeding its young it eats caterpillars, spiders, and various
kinds of insects, as well as leaves and unripe seeds of weeds; but at other times
it appears to confine its attentions principally to different kinds of seeds.
On several occasions bird-catchers have offered me Tree-Sparrows at from
twopence to threepence apiece; but the birds looked so vindictive and chirped so
savagely that, considering their powerful beaks, I decided not to risk associating
them with the other members of my feathered family. Although opinions differ
greatly respecting the character of this species, I am satisfied that I adopted the
safest course. Stevenson (Birds of Norfolk, Vol. I, p. 209) says:-"In confinement
the Tree-Sparrows are certainly the shyest and most untameable of any birds I
have ever introduced into my aviary, and even time seems to work but little change
in their wild nature, as on the approach of any person, whether a stranger or not,
they dash about the cage in a reckless manner, and when exhausted and panting
with fright, will creep into any corner or dark spot to escape notice."
Lord Lilford observes:-"In captivity the Tree-Sparrow thrives well upon
canary- and millet-seed, and becomes very tame."†
Swaysland, who has had considerable experience in keeping many of our
British Birds, remarks:-"When caught do not place immediately in an aviary, as
they would then invariably sulk and behave wildly, frightening the other birds,
but rather keep in a small cage until tame."
Howard Saunders (Manual, p. 174) says:-"In captivity this species has bred
A female Orphean Warbler was shot near St. Leonards (Sussex), on October
7th, 1903, and an immature male was found dead near St. Leonards, on September
16th, 1905.
The Garden Warbler was seen in the Outer Hebrides, in September 1904,
and in the Shetlands, in September 1905.
The following should be added to the occurrences of the Barred Warbler:-
two males secured at Woodchurch, Kent, on April 24th, 1907; one in Norfolk,
September 13th, 1902; one near Fleetwood, Lancashire, on August 20th, 1898;

September 20th, 1902, and a third on September 4th, 1905; a young bird on
Barra, Outer Hebrides, October 29th, 1900.
The Dartford Warbler was identified at Wells, Norfolk, on December 15th,
1905; two pairs nested near Ludlow, Shropshire, in 1903; and it is believed to
have nested near Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, about 1870.

THE SARDINIAN WARBLER.
Sylvia melanocephala, GMEL.
A male was shot near Hastings, on June 3rd, 1907, and was identified by
Thomas Parkin, Esq., F.Z.S.
The Fire-crested Wren (male and female), was shot in Breconshire, on February
27th, 1899.
A male Yellow-browed Warbler was shot at Fair Isle, on September 25th,
1905, and six were seen in September of the year following; one was captured
in the Outer Hebrides, on September 21st, 1906, and a male was knocked down
with a stick at Tresco (Scilly), on October 1st, 1905.
forming its staple diet, varied in the summer by a few mealworms or cockroaches;
when wild it is said to eat grasshoppers; it also eats a little fruit. A caged
example is chiefly interesting for the show-bench; consequently the unfortunate
specimen captured in Fifeshire seems to have had a busy life at the hands of his
owners. In an aviary this species would doubtless be more interesting, but it
would want watching at first, unless associated with birds as powerful as itself;
for some of the buntings are dangerously sportive towards smaller and weaker birds.

THE CORN-BUNTING.
Emberiza miliaria, LINN.
IT would be useless to attempt to improve upon Seebohm's account of the
distribution of this species:-"Beyond the British Islands its range extends
throughout Central and Southern Europe. It is only found in the extreme
south of Norway and Sweden; and east of the Baltic its northern limit appears
to be Riga. It it doubtful if it has ever occurred as far north as Moscow or the
Ural Mountains; but it is very locally distributed in Southern Russia, where it
is a partial migrant. It is a resident in the Caucasus and Western Turkestan,
and there is an example in the museum at Omsk, said to have been obtained in
the neighbourhood. It is a resident in the Canaries and North-western Africa;
but in Egypt and Arabia Petræa it is only found during winter, whence it probably
migrates to Central Europe to breed. It is a resident in Palestine, Asia Minor,
and North Persia, as far south as Shiraz." (Hist. Brit. Birds, Vol. II, pp. 148-9).
In Great Britain the Corn-Bunting is very local in its distribution, being
most abundant in well-cultivated grain-producing districts. In the south of England
it perhaps deserves its name of "Common Bunting," though it is by no means so
abundant as the Yellow Hammer, but northward it is rarer and far more local; in

WHEN I was asked to prepare the first volume of this work for the press,
I was already busily engaged upon the preparation of two other books,
one of which was published about a fortnight before the said first
volume appeared, the other being still in hand as I write. It need, therefore, be
a matter of no surprise to my readers, that I was unable, for lack of time, to
ferret out particulars respecting all the recent accidental visitors to our shores-
some of them, doubtless, man-assisted immigrants, or that I overlooked some extra
occurrences of visitors already recorded in British Bird books. Had the admirable
articles by the late Howard Saunders, and by Messrs. H. F. Witherby and N.
F. Ticehurst been then published, I admit that it would have been better to
include all these vagrants (as has been done in the present volume), but, under
the circumstances, it was impossible for me to devote the necessary time to
elaborate this subject. This has been most ably accomplished in the first volume
of that excellent magazine-"British Birds," by the above-mentioned gentlemen.
As one reviewer of my first volume considered me very remiss in not bringing
the list of chance visitors up-to-date (though each year adds to the list), I propose
to remedy the deficiency here as far as possible, though it is impossible to keep
pace with the constantly published records of occurrences.

THE DUSKY THRUSH.
Turdus dubius, BECHST.
ONE specimen is said to have been shot near Gunthorpe, Notts., on October
13th, 1905.
The Twite, Mountain Linnet, Hill Lintie, or "Yellow-neb Lintie," as it is
variously called, is a frequenter in summer of the hilly districts and moorlands of
the northern portions of Great Britain and Ireland; but, as winter approaches,
it deserts the bleaker regions and wanders in small flocks through the cultivated
lowlands in search of seeds of charlock and other weeds, upon which it feeds: at
this season it frequently consorts with the Linnet.
Lord Lilford says that his acquaintance with this species is chiefly confined
to having often met with it on the moors of Scotland, when Grouse-shooting in
August and September. "At that season it is generally to be met with in small
family parties of six or eight, flitting about grassy spots amongst the heather,
and feeding on various small seeds. It may be distinguished, even at some
distance, from the Common Linnet on the wing by its lighter make, darker colour,
and sharp call-note. In captivity this species becomes very tame, but has not
much to recommend it, as the song, though sweet, is short, broken, and of
little power."
The call-note has been described as resembling the word twah-it of which the
name Twite is a fanciful rendering; on the wing it twitters, somewhat in the
fashion of the Linnet; the song, though inferior, is not much unlike that of the
same bird.
The nest of the Twite is usually built low down in heather, sometimes even
on the ground among grass, or on a rocky ledge; it is also said to occur in
bushes, and occasionally in ivy: it is neatly formed of rootlets, or heather inter-
mingled with grass-bents, and is lined with wool, hair and feathers, or thistle-
down. The eggs number from four to six, usually five, are pale greenish-blue,
speckled, spotted, blotched, or streaked with reddish-brown; they are indistinguish-
able from those of the Linnet, though most observers seem to agree in saying
that they are more frequently streaked than eggs of that bird. As a matter of
fact, if a number of eggs of the Goldfinch, Lesser Redpoll, Twite, and Linnet
were indiscriminately mixed, no living Ornithologist could sort them again with
any degree of confidence: they all vary in size, depth, and tint of colouring and
markings.
Although I am satisfied that the Twite could, as easily as other Finches,
complete its nest in two or three days provided it was ready to lay, Saxby has
recorded an instance in which both sexes were occupied for eight days in completing
one: this is often the case at the commencement of the breeding season,* when
the birds are in no special hurry, just as with Canaries in the breeding-cage, but
I always purchase my Goldfinches as "Grey-pates"; and as they have plenty
of exercise and abundance of nourishing food, my birds when adult are frequently
mistaken by breeders for "Russians"; when first turned out they always have
plenty of hemp and teasel, with groundsel and chickweed; and there is usually a
saucer of soft-food in the aviary: the colours of the male birds are wonderfully
pure and brilliant, and the birds themselves are large and well-formed.
Mule-breeding between Goldfinch and Canary is easy enough, for I was
successful in my first essay; but between the Goldfinch and other Finches, there
is more difficulty (although this species sometimes hybridizes with the Greenfinch
in a wild state) especially in the case of the only really handsome cross-between
the Goldfinch and Bullfinch. The variety of Goldfinch known as a "Cheverel"
is sometimes preferred for muling purposes; it differs from the normal form in
having the centre of the throat white.
The bird-catchers assert that Goldfinches from different parts of our islands
sing differently; and they call the best singers "Slammers," from a fancied
resemblance of part of the song to the words-"Slam-so-witty, slippity-cur," with
other rubbish which no bird could whistle.

THE MEALY REDPOLL.
Acanthis linaria, LINN.
SEEBOHM treats the Redpolls as races of one species, but considers that the
typical form, A. linaria, and the two extremes, A. rufescens and A.
hornemanni, are worthy of subspecific rank; at least that seems to me to
be the only construction to be put upon his observations. Howard Saunders, on
the other hand, unites A. linaria and A. hornemanni, remarking:-"for the sake
of convenience, I propose to treat the Mealy Redpolls under one heading, and to

THE GREENFINCH.
Ligurinus chloris, LINN.
OF the geographical distribution of the Greenfinch, Dr. Sharpe says that it
inhabits:-"Europe generally; the countries bordering the Mediterranean;
accidental in Madeira; extending eastwards in Persia and North-western
Turkestan."
In Great Britain this common and well-known Grosbeak is generally distri-
buted, breeding in all suitable localities; but to the Orkneys, Hebrides, and
Shetlands, it is chiefly an autumn and winter visitant, though N. B. Kinnear, in
1907, recorded the fact that it breeds at Stornoway and has probably done so for
some time.
The Greenfinch varies considerably as regards brilliance of colouring; the birds
of the spring immigration being stated to be much paler and brighter in colouring
than the resident birds: the latter are largely added to in the autumn, by the
advent of immense flocks which arrive in October on our eastern coasts.
The adult male above is yellowish-olive, more yellow on the forehead and
rump; greater coverts grey; primary coverts edged with yellowish; primaries
greyish-brown, edged with yellow; secondaries with paler outer webs; tail feathers
yellow at the base, blackish at the ends, the central ones largely blackish; lores
blackish; a broad superciliary yellow stripe; ear-coverts grey; sides of face and
cheeks yellow, the latter somewhat greyish; under parts yellow, becoming whitish
on the abdomen; flanks greyish; beak flesh-coloured, darker towards the tip; feet
horn-brown; iris hazel. The female is similar in pattern to the male, but slightly
smaller, much duller and browner, the feathers of the head and mantle with dark
shaft-streaks; the underparts also are less yellow. After the moult the margins
of the feathers are paler, and the yellow less bright; but in the spring, as with
many other species, the tints become purer and more lively. The young are very
like the mother bird, but the feathers are somewhat more streaked; they acquire
the adult plumage after their first moult; but the colouring does not attain its
greatest brilliancy in the first year.
During the summer months the Greenfinch is a somewhat skulking bird, and
Family-CORVIDÆ.
THE JAY.
Garrulus glandarius, LINN.
WIDELY distributed and resident throughout Europe excepting in the
south-east: in Asia and Algeria several more or less differentiated
forms occur which interbreed and produce intergrades, thus rendering
their separation by Ornithologists a very arbitrary and difficult task.
Although still fairly common in the woodlands of England, in spite of the
incessant persecution to which it is subjected by game-keepers, farmers, and
gardeners, the Jay is rapidly becoming rarer in Scotland, yet is still by no
means scarce in the southern counties, whilst in Ireland, where it was (in all
probability) at one time, pretty generally distributed, it is now not only
confined to the south, but is only of local occurrence.
About the month of October, a considerable immigration of Jays takes place,
largely adding to the number bred in Great Britain.
This beautiful bird has the crown covered by a well-defined crest, the
smaller feathers of which are tipped and the larger ones streaked with black;
nape and back vinous-brown; rump and upper tail-coverts white; wing-coverts
with the outer webs regularly barred with black, white, and silvery-blue, the inner
webs black; primaries dull black, externally edged with white, secondaries shining
black, the innermost feather mostly chestnut, the remainder with large white
patches on the basal half of the outer web; tail black, the outer pair of feathers
brownish; ear-coverts pale vinous-brown; a broad black moustachial streak from
the base of the bill; chin and throat buffish-white; breast and abdomen vinaceous,
deeper on the flanks; vent and under tail-coverts white. Bill blackish horn-brown,
feet brown, iris vinous-brownish. The female resembles the male in colouring,
but is smaller, has a shorter crest and a broader and shorter bill. The young
chiefly differ in having the iris pale blue.
It is difficult to explain how it has come about that the colouring of the
adult and young eye in the Jay has been transposed in British Bird books. Like
many other young animals this bird when a baby has innocent blue eyes, which,
however, change soon after its first moult to a vinous-brownish colour, a little
