@ ( 72 ) ple were so much delighted ; another ceremonie was, that euery principall Mary‐bucke arid men of note amongst them, would take of the earth,which came forth of the place his graue was digged, and with the same water,which was in the pot,standing@@@@@@@@@@@@ in t@he same roome , would moysten the said earth,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ a@nd so forme therof a round ball, which they would carry away with them , and esteeme of as a great Relique : whereof my Alchade or Mary-bucke, be‑ cause of those perfumes I sent , was admitted to @haue one, which he so highly esteemed , I could not at any rate purchase it from him , although I made him o@ﬀers,of more then I meant to giue.
 This Assembly held@, for the space of ten dayes, with a continuall recourse,of comming and going, but not altogether for the buriall of the dead@; for after certayne dayes were spent in the celebrating of his Obsequies, then beganne a great solemnitie,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @for the establishi@ng and inuesting of his eldest sonn@@@@@@@@@@@@e@@ in his place and dignitie : whereunto came agay@@@@@@@@@@n@@@e many gif@ts,and presents: amongst those tha@t passed@@ by me,I tooke notice of a great Ramme,which was carried betweene two, bound fast and @layd vppon a hurdle.
 In the whole time I was in the Country, I@@@@@@@@@@@ neuer saw any Ramme, or Sheepe , but that which@@@@@@@@@ was brought very farre, @his woo@llmight more pro‑ perly be called haire, it was of that hardnesse@d did vnderstand by my Mary‐bucke , @he was to be vsed, after some manner of sacri@ﬁce , and I vnderstood likevvise, that in their high Priesthood , the sonne succeeded the father, & this course is held amongst their Religious orders, wherein they di@ﬀer from the temporall gouerments.
 It A Relique of great esteeme. The inuesting of the eldest sonne in the fathers place. A Ramme for sacriﬁce.
