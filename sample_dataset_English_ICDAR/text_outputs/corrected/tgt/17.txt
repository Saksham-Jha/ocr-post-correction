 90 To take the true-Plot of a Field. Fig.
 25 ment is any thing removed, you may eaffly try and recti@ﬁe it, by applying the @ﬁducial edge to the same Line, and making use of fore-ffghts and back-ffghts again, upon the same Marks which you before observed upon the oppoffte ffdes of the Close.
 But if there be no convenient place for the placing of your Instrument, whence you may ice all the Angles of the Field, more stations must be made use of thus: Let A B C D E F G H I K L M N be a Field whose Angles cannot be all seen from any one Angle, or other place in it: I plant my In- strument at the Angle A, and if it have a Needle, I mark what Degree of the Chord it cuts, or turn about the Table on the head of the Sta@ﬀ, till the Needle hang over over some remarkable place@; ( as suppose the Flower@-de-luce@) and screw it fast ; then setting up a Stick with a white paper or cloath on the head of it, where I intend my second Station ( as here at Q.
 ) I make a prick or point in my paper, to ffgniffe @the point A upon the paper on the Table@: to which@ point I apply the @ﬁducial edge of the In- dex, and when I see the white at Q, so@ as look- ing through the slit, I see the thread, cut it, I draw the Line O P quite through my Paper with a Black lead Pen, and then keeping the @ﬁducial edge still upon the same point, and turning it round by degrees, I look at the An- gles B C D E F L M N@, still drawing dry Li@nes w@ith the points of my Compasses, and set- ting on the Measures from the Sation A to e- very Angle measured to or from, as I did in the last Example@@.
