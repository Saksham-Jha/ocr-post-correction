 HIGH GERMANY. I will buy you a horse if my Polly can ride, And many a long night I will march @by her side, We’ll drink at every ale-house that e’er we come nigh, And we’ll travel on the road, sweet Polly and I. Down in yonder valley I’ll make for him a bed, And the sweetest of roses shall be his coverlet ; With pinks and sweet violets I will adorn his feet, Where the fishes are charmed, the music is so @@sweet. Woe be to the wars that ever they began, For they have pressed my Billy and many a clever man ; For they have pressed my Billy, no more shall I him see, And so cold is his grave in High Germany. The drums that beat is covered with green, The pretty lambs a sporting much pleasure to be seen, May the birds on the branches hinder my downfall, The leaving of my true love grieves me worst of all. H. DISLEY, Printer, 57, High Street, St. Giles, London. OH I IF I HAD A Wife that would love me. I am lonesome, forlorn, and dejected, There is no one so wretched as me, But if I had a wife that could love me, Like a sand boy so happy I’d be : With the best @of all @dainties I’d treat her, I would @love her by night and by day, I would never abuse her or beat her, @Take her each night t@o t@he play. Oh ! if I had a@@ wife @@tha@@t would love me, So joyful and happy I’d be, A good tempered wife is a blessing, Oh ! Providence find one for me.
 A man that is single is moping Oft into bad company led, At night in the dark he goes groping, And can scarce find the way to his bed ; But if he had a wife to delight him, A far different subject he’d be, Away to his bed she would light him,  A woman, dear woman for me.
 Some men are not worthy a woman, They don’t know how to use a good wife, Oh ! Providence, grant me one favour, It would make me happy for life.
 I know many men who are married, Oft to kick up a row will begin, Only because the dear creatures Has taken a small drop of gin ; But I can prove all their ill-usage, They never will find any use, Remember, what’s good for the gander, Must always be good for the goose.
 Oh ! if I had a wife that would love me, It would free me from sorrow and pain, If displeased she’d often reprove me, But I’d@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @@@n@@@@@@@@@@@@e@@@@@@@@@@@@@v@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@e@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@r@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ li@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@v@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@e @s@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@i@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@n@g@@@@@@@@@@@@l@@@@@@e a@@@g@@@a@@@@@i@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@.
 O Polly love, O Polly love, the route it is begun, And we must away at the sound of the drum ; Go dress yourself in all your best, and come along with me, And I’ll take you to the wars in High Germany.
 O my dearest Billy, mind what you say, My feet they are sore and cannot march away ; Besides, my dearest Billy, I am with child by thee, And not fitting for the wars in High Germany.
 O Polly, love, O Polly, love, I lo@ve you very well, There are few in@ this place, my Polly can excel ; But @@when your baby’s born, @@love@, and sits@ @@smiling on your knee, You w@ill t@hink on your Billy @that is in High Germany.
 O Polly, love, O Polly, love, pray give @me your hand, @@And promise you will marry me @when @@I come@ to old @@England I give you my right hand@@, I @wil@l not @mar@@ried be, Till @@@@@you come @from the wars in High Germany.
 Oh ! if I had a wife that would love me, She should find @me both loving and kind ; I would clothe he@r @i@n silks and in satins, And buy her a large crinoline ; A Jack Sheppard hat and a feather, A bustle as big as a dray, Yes, I woul@d adorn @her for @ever, And nurse her by night and@ @by @day. I would take @her@ to balls, ro@@uts and races, And @treat her with biscuits and ales, We so@ happy would be@ @i@n @our places, As the @Pr@@in@@@ce @and the Prince@ss @of Wales. I am lonesome, @&c. I @o@ft@en times think of my mother, A kind, loving creature was she, And I’m certain there’s many another, So good, kind and virtuous may be ; I goes moping a@bout like a donkey, @No comfort have I when at ho@@me, But@ @looks @as sedate @a@@s a @monkey, Stuck @up in a corner alone ; But if I had a wife @gay and handy, @I would comfort her all @@day @and @night, She should smoke a cigar and drink bran@dy, And @knock me about when she liked.
