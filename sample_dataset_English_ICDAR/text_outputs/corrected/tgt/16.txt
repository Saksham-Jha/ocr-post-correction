 N°. 127. Old Poor Sir Robin@@@@@@@.
 @47@ Fix to his Legs a Pair of cloven Feet, And@ bring it to MY WORSHIP here to see’t.
 The Joiner went, and quickly made by Odds, The best of Devils of the worst of Gods.
 And now behold, the People all amaz’d, At what, as God they hated stood and gaz’d ; And all admiring as a Devil prais’d.
 The Churchwarden on seeing this relented, Paid down the Cas@h, and all were well contented.
 Cry’d with what Skill his Worship weigh’d the Cause ; Extoll’d his Wisdom much, and humm’d Applause, Aye (said the Justice) now you see it @ﬁne is, To have among you such a Head as mine is.
 Go clear the Halls; bid Susan bring my Cap ; I’ll drink my Bottle o@ﬀ, and have a Nap.
 Then to the Joiner, who was still in View, Come back, said he I want to speak to you, Now learn Instruction from a Man of Letters, And mind in future how you carve your Betters.
 As to t@his God : @this Devil here I mean, (For surely such a God was never seen.
) I stood your Friend, because I saw you starv’d ; But had it been an ALDERMAN you’d carv’d, As I’m alive, no Money should have bail’d you ; But spite of all your Friends, I should have jail’d you.
 OBSERVATIONS on the FOUR QUARTERS. The T HE Spring Quarter commences on the 20th Day of March, at   Hours, 53 Min.
 in the Morning, when the bright God of Day, mounted upon a Ram viffts the Northern Hemisphere, and in a few Weeks gallops o@ﬀ to a @Bull‑baiting : After this, he pays a friendly Vifft to two twin Broth@ers, aster which Spring retires, and Summer takes Place@@@@.
