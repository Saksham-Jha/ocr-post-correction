 ( 19 ) @ven and written ; but reason of State goes beyond all particular formes and pacts, and looks rather to t@he being, then well‐being of a State , and seeks to prevent mischiefe forraign as well as Domestick,by emer‑ gent CounseIs,and unwritten resolutions.
 Reason of State is something more sublime and imperiall then Law : it may be rightly said, that the Statesman begins where the Lawyer ceaseth: for when warre has fflen‑ ced Law , as it often does ; Policy is to bee observed as the only true Law , a kind of a dictatorian power is to be allowed to her ; what soe‑ ever has any right to defend it selfe in time of danger is to resort to po‑ licy in stead of Law , and it is the same thing in the Replicant, To deny to Parliaments recourse to reason of State in these miserable times of warre and danger , as to deny them self‐defence.
 Many men,especially Lawyers,would fain have Law alone take place in all times , but for my part I think it equally destructive to renounce reason of State,and adhere to Law in times of great extremity, as to re‑ nounce Law, & adhere to Policy in times of tranqui@@llity@@.Nothing has done us more harme of late, then this opinion of adhering to Law only for our preservation : & the King and his party though they are too wise themselves to observe Law at all,yet have wrought much upon the ffm‑ pler sort of our ffde by objecting against us neglect of Law.
 Certainly as our dangers now are, it would bee good for us to adde more power to the Earle of Essex ( if he be thought the worthiest man of Trust a‑ @mongst us,as he has deserved no lesse estimation ) for till I see him lookt upon , and served as a temporary Dictator, and the bounds of his Com‑ mi@@on to bee only this ; ne quid detrimenti capiat Respublica cavere : I shall never think the Parliaments safety su@@ﬃciently provided for. C 2 To frame any Arguments, or reasons,or to oﬀer proofes, that the Re‑ presentative body of the Kingdome is a Counsell of State, rather then a Court of Justice , would s@hew me as foolish as the Replicant@: 'tis im‑ po@@ble any man s@ho@uld doubt of it, that does think the being is to bee preferred before the well being ; or that whole Nations have any in‑ terests either in their owne being or well being.
 Let our Adversaries triumph in their owne conceits, and when in the same case there is both @matter of Law and State ( as in the case of Hull, where the King had an interest rather in State then Law ) let them upbraid us for declining of Law @: I shall like that best which they diflike most in us @: I wish we had not observed Law too farre, for they would never so farre recom@@@@@‑ mend
