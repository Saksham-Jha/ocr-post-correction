@(@is.) y<rn and written@; but reasoM of State goes beyond all particular formes and pacts, and looks rather ro tlie being, then well-being of@a State@, and seeks to prevent mifchiefe@forraign as well as Domestick,by emer@ gent Counsels,and unwritten resolutions.
 Reason of@State@is@fomething more sublime and imperiaJl then Law@: it may be rightly said, that the Statesman begins where the Lawyer ceaseth: for when warre has'silen@ ced Law@, as it often does@; Policy is to bee observed as the only true Law@, a kind@pf@a@dictatorian power is to be allowed to he@f; what@foc- ever has any right to defend it seise in time@of@danger@is@to resort to po@ licy in stead of Law@, and it is the fame thing in the Replicant, To deny to Parliaments recourse to reason of@State in these miserable times of warre and danger@, as to deny them@self defence.
 Many men,efpecially@Lawyers,would fain have Law alone take place in all times@, but for my part I think it equally destructive to renounce reason of State,and adhere to Law in times@of@great extremity, as to re@ nounce Law,@& adhere to Policy in times of tranqui 1 Jity ,JNothing hac done us more harme of late, then this opinion of adhering to Law only for our preservation@; & the King and his party though they are too wile themselves to observe Law at all,yet have wrought much upon the sim@ pler sort of our side by objecting against us neglect of Law.
 Certainly as our dangers now are, it would@bcc good for us@to@adde more power to the Earle of EJsex@( if he be thought the worthiest man of Trust a- raongst us,as he has deserved no Jesse estimation@) for till 1 see him lookc upon@, and served as a temporary Dictator, and the bounds of his Com@ mission to bee only this@; ne quid detrimenti capiat Respuklica cavere@i I @Hull never think the Parliaments safety sufficiently provided for@@@,. To frame any Arguments, or reasons,or toofftr proofes,@that the Re@ presentative body of the Kingdome is a Counsel! of State, rather then a Court of Justice@, would strew me as foolish as the Replicant.* 'ti* im@ possible any man stiottld doubt of it, that does think the being is to bee preferred before.the well being@; or that whole Nations have any in@ terests either in their owne being or well being.
 Let our Adversaries triumph in their owne conceits, and when in the@seme@case there is both tnatter@of@Law and<?tate (@as@in@the@case@of Hull, where@the@King@had@an interest rather in State then La@@@ let them upbraid us for declining of Law .* I shall like that best which they dislike most in us .* I@wish we had@not observed Law too farre, for they would never so farr* rcaom.
