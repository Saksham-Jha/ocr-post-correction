@To take the true Fl 0 t of a Field, 9@@@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@@@x Then I remove the Instrument to the place f b, if of my second station, having set up a mark at A,and laying the fiducial edge to the Line O P, I turn about the Table upon the head of the Staff, till through the flit of the back-sight, I fee the thread cutting the mark at A, and then screw it fast, so will my Needle, if a good one, hang directly over the same point that it did j at the first station \ but however that be, fore@ sight and back-sight will do the business; for which purpose it is good to take@back-marks as well 'as iore-marks at every station, as was taught in the Example of a single station, only taking notice that@ the back-mark when the In@ strument i> planted in an Angle, must needs be out of the Field 5 as suppose here at O.
 But to proceed.
 Having measured the distance between the fust and second station, and finding it to be 7.
10,@1 set it upon the Line O P, from A to Qv where 1 make another^ point to represent the second station, and turning about my Index with the fiducial edge upon that point, and so look@ ing through the fights at the Angles G H I@K, I tiraw Lines towards them on my Paper, a nd having measured between every one of those four Angles, and the Instrument, I set those Measures as I did the other, with my Scale and (Compasses, from Q@jowarcls every Angle upon ihis proper Line: and then having drawn the (black bounding-lines from A to B, from B to C land so round about the Close, the Protraction i; finished.
 But here to make this Figure yet more ad-' vantageous,
