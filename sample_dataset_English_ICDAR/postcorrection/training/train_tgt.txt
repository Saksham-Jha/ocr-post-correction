 THE BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE.
* Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note, As his corpse to the rampart we hurried ; Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot O'er the grave where our hero we buried.
 We buried him darkly at dead of night, The sods with our bayonets turning; By the struggling moonbeam's misty light, And the lantern dimly burning.
 No useless coffin enclosed his breast, Not in sheet nor in shroud we wound him; But he lay like a warrior taking his rest, With his martial cloak around him.
 † Few and short were the prayers we said, And we spoke not a word of sorrow ; But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead, And we bitterly thought of the morrow.
 We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed, And smoothed down his lonely pillow, That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head, And we far away on the billow ! Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone, And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him,  But little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on In the grave where a Briton has laid him.

 After the massacre of the Caribs, an act of brutal barbarity which Du Tertre calls a glorious victory, the settlers were troubled no more by the natives, and the French and English colonists remained at peace with one another, cultivating the fruitful soil and increasing in wealth and numbers.
 Warner and D’Esnambuc returned each to his own country.
 Warner was knighted in 1625, receiving the appointment to the Governorship of St.
 Chris- topher, and came again that year to the island, accompanied by four hundred new recruits.
 D’Esnambuc, who, being taken under the patronage of Cardinal Richelieu, was joined by more than five hundred emigrants, put to sea in February, 1627, with his expedition, in ships so poorly equipped and provisioned that many of the company perished miserably during the voyage for want of food.
 The survivors were kindly received by the English settlers, for they took pity on the Frenchmen in their wretched plight and gave them such provisions as could be spared from their own scanty store ; thus the people of the two nations for many years lived amicably together on their island- home.
 In the reign of Charles I.
, during his war with the Dutch, France having declared for the latter the French settlers in St.
 Christopher, unmindful of past favors, drove the Englishmen from their settlement.
 The exiles thus unceremoniously driven away by their ungrateful neighbors, were however restored to their homes and lands by the Treaty of Breda.
 During the Revolution in England the French, pre- tending to espouse the cause of the abdicated king, expelled the Eng- lish a second time from St.
 Christopher and remained for nearly a year sole masters of the island.
 This action on their part is alleged to have been one of the causes that induced William and Mary to de- clare war against Louis XIV.
 In 1690 General Codrington, Governor of Barbados, on receipt of the news of the Battle of the Boyne, fitted out an armament to capture St.
 Christopher.
 In this adventure all the English islands joined.
 The expedition consisted of three thou- sand armed men, of which number seven hundred were English sol- DOWN THE ISLANDS. ( 217 ) will be content , there is no doubt , but they are all bound, by the agreement.

 I dreamt last night, och ! bad cess to me dreaming, I’d die if I thought ’twould come truly to pass : I dreamt, as the tears down my pale cheeks was streaming  That Teddy was courting another fair lass.
 Oh, did not I wake with the weeping and wailing, The thought of my dhra@me was too much to conceal, And my mother cries, “ N@orah, child, what is’t you’re ailing ?@” When all I could answer’ was “ Teddy O’Neale.
” Can I ever forget when th  big ship was ready,@@ The time it had come for my love to depart, I cried like a colleen, and said, “ Good-bye, Teddy,” With a tear in my eye, and a stone at my heart ; He said, ’twas to better his fortune he weñt roving, But what is the gold to the joy I could feel, If he would only come back to me, honest and loving, Though poor is my own darling Teddy O’Neale.

@@@@ I ’M a broken-hearted drunkard, in grief I’m arrayed, Through the cursed alehouse, where I’ve so often stayed And spent all my wages, which for nothing I’ve seen, But a home of destruction both shabby and mean.
 I was bare as a robin, my ho@me never clean ; Through the streets I did ramble, not fit to be seen.
 The landlord could ride in his carriage and pair  While my wretched home was both naked and bare : His gold chain did hang down so beautiful and long, I thought him kind-hearted, but I found I was wrong.
 On a good Sunday morning, to his house I would go, At the sound of my half-pence he his face would soon show, With a smile upon his countenance, and a wink in his eye, Saying, the money you’re got now, I shall have by-and-by.
 He was as proud as a squire that ever, was seen, Was that hard-hearted landlord, to whom so oft I’d been.
 But of such as me, he’s got silver and gold, And a carriage to ride in, both handsome and bold, His son he can dress, like a Prince or a King, His wife and his daughter, in their silks and satins.
 I asked him to trust me, he said, ‘ That’s all stuff, If your money it is gone, I’ve had quite enough Of your company, at the same time you are very kind, If your money it is gone, why no beer shall I find.
 Oh, the words that he did utter went straight to my heart, I jumped from my seat and quick did depart@@@@@@@@, With a tear on my eye-lid as big as a bean, Saying, “ Good bye, to the landlord, here no   re I’ll be seen.” 511.

A few can touch the magic string, And noisy fame is proud to win them ; Alas, for those that never sing, But die with all their music in them !

The Order and Method of the Discourse of Childrens Diseases.
 It is answered, 1.
 Every Age is ob‑ noxious to all kinds of Diseases, but one Age is more disposed to some Diseases , then another is ; for every Age hath a peculiar temper, and so a ffmilitude with some Diseases , whereby it is more eaffly a@ﬀected and changed by them @then by other Diseases ; nevertheless , Age it self doth not produce Diseases , but only disposes and makes one apt to receive certain sorts of Diseases ; for Age is a thing that is natural , and a De‑ termination of a time ; and it is de@ﬁned by some to be a Space and Duration of Life , in which the Constitution of the Body is manifestly changed, by the Acti‑ on of the natural heat upon the radical Moisture.
 The Life of Man conffsts in Heat and Moisture , the Heat consumes by degrees the Moisture , whereby ne‑ ce@sarily follows several Changes of the Temperament, which are called Ages.

 The Evangelist Luke wrote all that@@ Christ taught till his Ascenffon , and Saint John added as much concern‑ ing the miracles of Christ , as@@ was enough for motive to faith.
 From all which we argue, Christ was i@n the@@ bosome of the Father , and knew all ; he@@ came from thence a@@nd to@ld all, his Scholars at his command preached@;and , for the bene@ﬁt@@@@@@@@@ of future times, wrote all.
 We@@ acknowledge they dis , recei‑ ved their books , a@nd are sati@@@@@@s‑ @ﬁed; only the Papists and some other Hereticks , that they@@ @might have the honour and@@@@ pro@ﬁt to make the@@ supply , say@@ they did@ not ; b@ut who will believe them@? when Christ@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ ( 19 ) @ven and written ; but reason of State goes beyond all particular formes and pacts, and looks rather to t@he being, then well‐being of a State , and seeks to prevent mischiefe forraign as well as Domestick,by emer‑ gent CounseIs,and unwritten resolutions.
 Reason of State is something more sublime and imperiall then Law : it may be rightly said, that the Statesman begins where the Lawyer ceaseth: for when warre has fflen‑ ced Law , as it often does ; Policy is to bee observed as the only true Law , a kind of a dictatorian power is to be allowed to her ; what soe‑ ever has any right to defend it selfe in time of danger is to resort to po‑ licy in stead of Law , and it is the same thing in the Replicant, To deny to Parliaments recourse to reason of State in these miserable times of warre and danger , as to deny them self‐defence.
 Many men,especially Lawyers,would fain have Law alone take place in all times , but for my part I think it equally destructive to renounce reason of State,and adhere to Law in times of great extremity, as to re‑ nounce Law, & adhere to Policy in times of tranqui@@llity@@.Nothing has done us more harme of late, then this opinion of adhering to Law only for our preservation : & the King and his party though they are too wise themselves to observe Law at all,yet have wrought much upon the ffm‑ pler sort of our ffde by objecting against us neglect of Law.
 Certainly as our dangers now are, it would bee good for us to adde more power to the Earle of Essex ( if he be thought the worthiest man of Trust a‑ @mongst us,as he has deserved no lesse estimation ) for till I see him lookt upon , and served as a temporary Dictator, and the bounds of his Com‑ mi@@on to bee only this ; ne quid detrimenti capiat Respublica cavere : I shall never think the Parliaments safety su@@ﬃciently provided for. C 2 To frame any Arguments, or reasons,or to oﬀer proofes, that the Re‑ presentative body of the Kingdome is a Counsell of State, rather then a Court of Justice , would s@hew me as foolish as the Replicant@: 'tis im‑ po@@ble any man s@ho@uld doubt of it, that does think the being is to bee preferred before the well being ; or that whole Nations have any in‑ terests either in their owne being or well being.
 Let our Adversaries triumph in their owne conceits, and when in the same case there is both @matter of Law and State ( as in the case of Hull, where the King had an interest rather in State then Law ) let them upbraid us for declining of Law @: I shall like that best which they diflike most in us @: I wish we had not observed Law too farre, for they would never so farre recom@@@@@‑ mend@@@@ Part.

 And thus in his 8th Particular, that oc‑ caffons my Debate; He supposes, That the whole Nature of Corporeal Substance contain’d in a space of Ten, or any Number of Feet, may be understood without any Computation of it, as locally Commensurable ; and this to be accom‑ plish’d by a sole Idea of the Mind, in his Opinion.
 But is it po@@ble to promote meer Thought, by an Insenffble Act, suitable to the purpose he intends it? Can a Man that never under‑ stood how a Plain Super@ﬁcies may contain Body, or is produc’d according to his Exam‑ ple, to a space of Ten Feet; Conceive, or Delineate such a Figure, without know‑ ing that it is Compleated by Multiplying of 5 by 2 ? R Should a Mathematical Tutor Inform his Pupil, That it would be su@@ﬃcient for his In‑ struction, if by Mental Speculation he Ima‑ ginְ’d that there was, in Nature, such a Thing as a Plain Super@ﬁcies, tho’ he did not appre‑ hend that Longitude and Latitude were its Numerical Proprieties: Could Science be Improv’d by such an Impertinent and Idle@@ Idea (40) And how it got the upper hand of your precede@nt Order so well Constituted before, if we may beleeve those men whose profe@@on gives them cause to enquire most, it may be doubted there was in it the fraud of some old patentees and monopolizers in the trade of book‐selling ; who under pretence of the poor in their Company not to be defrauded, and the just retaining of each man his severall copy, which God forbid should be gainsaid, brought divers gloffng colours to the House, which were indeed but colours, and serving to no end except it be to exercise a superiority over their neigh‑ bours, men who doe not therefore labour in an honest profe@@on to which learning is indetted , that they should be made other mens vassalls.
 Another end is thought was aym'd at by some of them in procuring by petition this Order, that having power in their han  , malignant books might the eaffer scape abroad,as the event shews. But of these Sophisms and Elenchs of marchandize I skill not : This I know, that errors in a good government and in a bad are equally almost incident; for what Magistrate may not be mis‐inform'd,and much the sooner, if liberty of Printing be reduc't into the power of a few ; but to redresse willingly and speedily what hath bin err'd@, and in highest autority to esteem a plain advertisement more then others have done a sumptuous bribe,is a vertue(honour'd Lords and Commons) answerable to Your highest actions, and whereof none can participat but greatest and wisest @men.

 This may refer either to the Revelation of the Law , or of the Gospell, to that of Moses , or that of Christ.
 If it refer to that of Moses , yet the Reve‑ lation of the Law by@@ him might be of great use, by seting out , as it were a Se‑ cond Edition of it upon Tables of Stone, when it was so miserably defaced before upon the minds of Men.
 If it refer to the Gospell, that also might be of very great use , notwithstanding all the clearest Revelations that were made either by the Law of Nature , or by the Law of Moses , because the Revelation of the Gospell contains in it something , that was never deffgned to be made known, at least, so fully , by either : And he will not, I suppose, say , that the method of sal‑ vation, now revealed in the Gospel is con‑ tain'd in the Law of Nature, tho' it had been writ in as fair Characters , as that of the two Tables of Stone ; nor can he say , that the Law of Nature fully , and clear‑ ly Imprinted upon the minds of Men , would render any further Revelation ( particularly that of@ the Gospel ) use‑ less.
