@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ ( 104 ) tural Religion , seriously , and impartially sonffdered and followed , would by easy steps lead a Man to the imbraceing of the@@ Christian 2.
 Christianity , and natural Religion have the same generall end, and deffgne, to promote the honour of God , and the good of Men by Temperance , Righteous‑ ness and Holiness, and then, as to the ad‑ ditions contained in the revealed Religion, they are not any vicious mixtures , or a‑ dulterations of the natural, but rather im‑ provements of it to higher degrees of ex‑ cellency and perfection : Christianity doth not propound any less noble end, nor makes use of any less e@ﬀectual meanes than na‑ tural Religion doth, but rather advances, and improves both : So that if it be po@‑ bIe to be safe in the natural, it is much more so in the revealed Religion, Christi‑ anity has all the advantages of natural Re‑ ligion and many more.
 Then as to the di@@ﬃculties that are pre‑ tended to accompany the practise@ of the Christian Religion, Viz.
 A more profound morti@ﬁcation of our lusts, and pa@@ons, a@nd a more exalted degree of holiness, and piety , this certainly is rather an argument of its excellence than any diminution of it, especially conffdering the great as‑ @ffstan@ce Pars with a quarell.

 Your eternal folio's don't please me ; and, except a great Plutarch which I put my bands in, you ought to burn all this useless lumber, and leave learning to your great doctors about town ; to do right, you s@hould remove out of the garret that long telescope enough to frighten people, and a hundred knick-knacks the ffght of which are offenffve : Not to look after what is done in the moon, but to mind a little what's done at home, where we see every thing go topsy-turvy.
 It is not right for a great many rea- sons, that a wife s@hould study and know so many things.
 To form the minds of her children to good-manners, to see her family go on well, to have an eye over her servants, and to regulate with oeconomy what is expend- ed, ought to be her study and philosophy.
 Our fore- fathers were very wise people in this point, who said that a wife always knew enough when the capacity of her genius rais'd her to understand a doublet and a pair of breeches.
 Their wives did not read, but they liv'd well ; their families were all their learned discourse, and their books, a thimble, thread, and needles, with which they work'd amidst their knot of maids.
 But the women of this age are very far from behaving themselves in that manner, they must write and turn authors.
 No science is too profound for 'em ; and in my house, more than in any other place in the world, the most lofty secrets arc conceiv'd, and they understand every thing but what they ought to understand.
 They know the motions of the moon, the polar star, Venus, Saturn, and Mars, whom I have no buffness with ; and with all this vain knowlege, which they go so far to look for, they don't know how my pot goes on, which I have occaffon for.

 The great contrivers of our sad diviffons, which abuse the weake rea‑ fon of the people, to keepe up an   fortunate misunder@ﬆanding between King and Subject are not named by the Rep@li@cant ; but they are clearely pointed out to be the Chi@efe Lords and Commons in Parliament : for he saith, Every new Vote of late hath been a new a@ ﬂiction : a@nd he makes Pennington and the Citty Lecturers to be but Iourney‐men R@ebe@ls under them : and even this Hellish flander he venteth under the name of the Petitioners, whem he stiles the most conffderable persons of the Citty : and at the@ same time a@@ﬃrmeth,that the people generally are of hon@est a@ﬀections.
 And the Answer to the Petition in which@@,t@he words (he saies) are softer then oyle , though the matter of it be poison of A@@es, he attributes only to some C@hiefe Engineers of mischiefe in the House, though it carry in it the Authority of the whole House. Here is a wonder be‑ yond all wonders.
 A few factious persons i@n Parliament over‐awe the ma‑ jor, better and wiser part in Parliament ; and by a few factious Instruments in Citty and Count@re@y abuse @the major,better and wiser part there also into the most miserable distempers and calamities that ever were ; and though the honest generality begin to gro@w wiser and are instructed by the sence of their miseries, and by other advertisements from loyall Papi@ﬁs and Prelate@s, and other pious Courtiers and souldiers to shake o@ﬀ their few Tormentors : Nay , and though the King himself has not onely publisht the most eloquent and subtill Declarations to disabuse t@he people , that ever were (himselfe be‑ ing the most beloved and honoured Prince that ever was for his indulgence to Liberty and Religion) but ha h also advanced a most puissant and victo‑ rious Army to tele ve these undeceived wretches; yet the incantation holds, no humane force either of A@rmes or Arts can dissolve it.
 The miracles of @@@Moses had an impre@@on of divine vertue upon them, and did@ therefore tri‑ umph over all the Egyptians spels : but in this case, M@r Pym, with I know not what infernall engines distorts and wrests all the Orbes of a Kingdome@ from their naturall motions ; and yet no divine Art can reffst him.
 ' was ne‑ ver beleev'd before that any but God could work contrary to nature, but now it must be beleeved.
 But is it so apparent that the Parliament is averse from peace ? yet saies the Replicant, For withdraw the fuell, and the @ﬁre is soon extinguisht : Let the @Parliament not foment the ill humour (@by supplyes of men, Armes and A@mmu@nition@)and the wound will he@ale of it selfe.
 In the pe‑ tition, nothing but an Accommodation, safe and honourable was pretended, but now we see a meere submi@@on is intended in this replication@.
 T s not prooved : That the Ar@mes of the Parliament are unjust; 'tis not prooved;that it may be safe for the Kingdome to prostrate, and subject Par‑ liaments to the discretion of that faction which now has bereav'd us of the Kings presence and favour, yet because the Replicant will take upon him to    demne Parliaments; we must also allow of his Judgement. what the Replicant hath set forth, wee shall now see in the same order.
