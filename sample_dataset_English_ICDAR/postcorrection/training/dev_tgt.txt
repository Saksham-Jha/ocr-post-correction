 One cannot but make a re@ﬂection here, that our ancestors in their rough‑hewn age, without pretenffons, to any smoothness of manners, (though they felt themselves@ restrained by that sacred horror with which they regarded all Precedent, from presuming to bring about any reformation in the@ laws they found ready made to their hands, particularly those relative to my im‑ mediate subject;) yet took care to build so many Cities of refuge against the pursuers, that it is hard to conceive, how any body could fall their victim.
 Beffdes, the protections granted with‑ out stint of numbers by the sovereign@, all peers, members of parliament, particular magistrates, the verge of every palace, (and palaces could not fail of being numerous, while a splendid house@ was enough to prove its possessor a traitor)@ beffdes the asylum of churches and convents, they granted immunities to certain places, of which the Fleet remained the last instance in our time.
 Every one of these have been ex@@‑ tinguis@hed one after another in contra‑gradation to the advancement humanity was making among@@ us.

 @47@ Fix to his Legs a Pair of cloven Feet, And@ bring it to MY WORSHIP here to see’t.
 The Joiner went, and quickly made by Odds, The best of Devils of the worst of Gods.
 And now behold, the People all amaz’d, At what, as God they hated stood and gaz’d ; And all admiring as a Devil prais’d.
 The Churchwarden on seeing this relented, Paid down the Cas@h, and all were well contented.
 Cry’d with what Skill his Worship weigh’d the Cause ; Extoll’d his Wisdom much, and humm’d Applause, Aye (said the Justice) now you see it @ﬁne is, To have among you such a Head as mine is.
 Go clear the Halls; bid Susan bring my Cap ; I’ll drink my Bottle o@ﬀ, and have a Nap.
 Then to the Joiner, who was still in View, Come back, said he I want to speak to you, Now learn Instruction from a Man of Letters, And mind in future how you carve your Betters.
 As to t@his God : @this Devil here I mean, (For surely such a God was never seen.

 OBSERVATIONS on the FOUR QUARTERS. The T HE Spring Quarter commences on the 20th Day of March, at   Hours, 53 Min.

 I did ; and going did a rainbow note ; Surely, thought I, This is the lace of Peace's coat ; I will search out the matter.
 But while I looked the clouds immediately Did break and scatter.
 Then went I to a garden and did spy A gallant flower, The crown imperial ; sure, said I, Peace at the root must dwell.
 But when I digged, I saw a worm devour What showed so well.
 At length I met a reverend good old man ; Whom when for Peace I did demand, he thus began : There was a Prince of old At Salem dwelt, who lived with good increase Of flock and fold.
 He sweetly lived ; yet sweetness did not save His life from foes.
 But after death out of his grave There sprang twelve stalks of wheat ; Which many wondering at, got some of those To plant and set.
 It prospered strangely, and did soon disperse Through all the earth ; For they that taste it do rehearse That virtue lies therein ; A secret virtue, bringing peace and mirth By flight of sin. [BK.
