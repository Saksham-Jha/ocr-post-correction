 Christianity , and natural Religion have the fame generall end, and designe, to promote the honour of God@, and the good of Men by Temperance@, Righteous@ ness and Holinels, and then, as to the ad@ ditions contained in the revealed Religion, they are not any vicious mixtures@, or a- dulterations of the natural, but rather im@ provements of it to higher degrees of ex@ cellency and perfection : Christianity doth not propound any less noble end, nor makes use of any less effectual meanes than na@ tural Religion doth, but rather advances, and improves both : So that if it be possi ble to be safe in the natural, it is much more so in the revealed Religion, Christi@ anity has all the advantages of natural Re@ ligion and many more.
 Then as to the difficulties that are pre@ tended to accompany the practise* of the Christian Religion, Vt&.
 A more profound mortification of our lusts, and passions, ai d a more exalted degree of holiness, and piety@, this certainly is rather an argument of its excellence than any diminution of it, especially considering the great as- CtO-'>n<v-@@I tttrt) a quate@U.

 *7 nuke strange ones yourself in conduct.
 Your eternal folio’s don’t please me ; and, except a great Plutarch which I put my bands in, you ought to hu@m all this useless lumber, and leave learning to your great doctors about town@; to do right, you sliould remove out of the garret that long telescope enough to frighten people, and a hundred knick-knacks the fight of which are offensive:' Not to look after what is done in the moon, but to mind a little what’s done at home, where we fee every thing go topsy-turvy.
 It is not right for a great many rea@ sons, that a wise stiould study and know so many things.
 To form the minds of her children to good-manners, to fee her family go on well, to have an eye over her servants, and to regulate with oeconomy what is expend@ ed, ought to be her study and philosophy.
 Our fore@ fathers were very wife people in this point, who said that a wife aiwavs knew enough when the capacity of her genius rais’d her to understand a doublet and a pair of breeches.
 Their wives did not read, but they liv’d well@; their families were all their learned discourse, and their books, a thimble, thread, and needles, with which they work'd amidst their knot Of maids.
 But the women of this age are very far from behaving themselves in that manner, they must write and turn authors.
 No science is too profound for ’em@; and in my house, more-than in any other place in the world, the most lofty secrets arc conceiv’d, and they understand every thing but what they ought to understand.
 They know the motions of the moon, the polar star, Venus, Saturn, and Mars, whom I have no business with@; and with all this vain kuowlcge, which they go so far to look for, thev don’t know how my pot goes on, which I have occasion for.
 My servants too aspire after learning, to please you, and- * B ito what the 'Repltcant hath set forth, wee fTnit now see in the same order., I.
