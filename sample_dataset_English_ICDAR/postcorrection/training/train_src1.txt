 THE BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE.
* Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note, As his corpse to the rampart we hurried@; Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot O’er the grave where our hero we buried.
 We buried him darkly at dead of night, The sods with our bayonets turning; By the struggling moonbeam’s misty light, And the lantern dimly burning.
 No useless coffin enclosed his breast, Not in sheet nor in shroud we wound him; But he lay like a warrior taking his rest, With his martial cloak around him.
 f Few and short were the prayers we said, And we spoke not a word of sorrow@; But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead, And we bitterly thought of the morrow.
 We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed, And smoothed down his lonely pillow, That the foe and the stranger would tread o’er his head, And we far away on the billow ! Lightly they’ll talk of the spirit that’s gone, And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him,— But little he’ll reck, if they let him sleep on In the grave where a Briton has laid him.
 * First published anonymously in the Newry Telegraph, 1817.
 f ‘ A question arose as to which was the most perfect ode that had been produced.
 Shelley contended for Coleridge’s On Switzer land; others named some of Moore’s Melodies, and Campbell’s Hohenlinden. Lord Byron said, “ I will show you an ode I consider little inferior to the best which the present prolific age has produced ”.@Theatre Royal, Xhmry Lane.

 After the massacre of the Caribs, an act of brutal barbarity which Du Tertre calls a glorious victory, the settlers were troubled no more by the natives, and the French and English colonists remained at peace with one another, cultivating the fruitful soil and increasing in wealth and numbers.
 Warner and D'Esnambuc returned each to his own country.
 Warner was knighted in 1625, receiving the appointment to the Governorship of St.
 Chris@ topher, and came again that year to the island, accompanied by four hundred new recruits.
 D’Esnambuc, who, being taken under the patronage of Cardinal Richelieu, was joined by more than five hundred emigrants, put to sea in February, 1627, with his expedition, in ships so poorly equipped and provisioned that many of the company perished miserably during the voyage for want of food.
 The survivors were kindly received by the English settlers, for they took pity on the Frenchmen in their wretched plight and gave them such provisions as could be spared from their own scanty store@; thus the people of the two nations for many years lived amicably together on their island- home.
 In the reign of Charles I.
, during his war with the Dutch, France having declared for the latter the French settlers in St.
 Christopher, unmindful of past favors, drove the Englishmen from their settlement.
 The exiles thus unceremoniously driven away by their ungrateful neighbors, were however restored to their homes and lands by the Treaty of Breda.
 During the Revolution in England the French, pre@ tending to espouse the cause of the abdicated king, expelled the Eng@ lish a second time from St.
 Christopher and remained for nearly a year sole masters of the island.
 This action on their part is alleged to have been one of the causes that induced William and Mary to de@ clare war against Louis XIV.
 In 1690 General Codrington, Governor of Barbados, on receipt of the news of the Battle of the Boyne, fitted out an armament to capture St.
 Christopher.
 In this adventure all the English islands joined.

 I dreamt last night, och ! bad cess to me dreaming, I’d die if I thought ’twould come truly to pass s I dreamt, as the tears down my paie cheeks was Btreaming, That Teddy was courting another fair lass.
 Oh, did not 1 wake with the weeping and wailing, The thought of my dhrarue was too much to conceal, And my mother cries, “ N orah, child, what is’t you’re ailing ? ” When all I could answer’ was “ Teddy O’Neale.
” Can I ever forget when tts big ship was ready, ' The time it had come for my love to depart, I cried like a colleen, and said, “ Good-bye, Teddy,” With a tear in my eye, and a stone at my heart@; He said, 'twas to belter his fortune he weHt roving, But what ia the gold to the joy I could feel, If he would only come back to me, honest and loving, Though poor is my own darling Teddy O’Neale.

 opo I ’M a broken-hearted drunkard, in grief I’m arrayed. Through the cursed alehouse, where I’ve so often stayed And spent all my wages, which for nothing I’ve seen, But a home of destruction both shabby aud mean.
 I was bare as a robin, my borne never clean ; Through the streets I did ramble, not fit to be seen.
 The landlord could ride in his carriage and pair. While my wretched home was both naked and bare : His gold chain did hang down so beautiful and long, I thought him kind-hearted, but I found I was wrong.
 On a good Sunday morning, to his house I would go, At the sound of my half-pence he hiB face would soon show, With a smile upon his countenance, and a wink in his eye. Baying, the money you’ve got now, I shall have by-and-by.
 He was as proud as a squire that ever. was seen, Was that hard-hearted landlord, to whom so oft I'd been.
 But of such as me, he's got silver and gold, And a carriage to ride in, both handsome and bold, His son he can dress, like a Prince or a King, His wife and his daughter, in their silks and satina.
 I asked him to trust me, he said, ‘ That's all stuff, If your money it is gone, I’ve had quite enough Of your company, at the same time you are veij kind. If your money it is gone, why no beer shall I find.

 Some men are not worthy a woman, They don’t know how to use a good wife, Oh ! Providence, grant me one favour, It would make me happy for life.

I often times think of my mother, A kind, loving creature was she, And I’m certain there’s many another, So good, kind and virtuous may be; I goes moping about like a donkey, No comfort have I when at home, But looks as sedate as a monkey, Stuck up in a comer alone ; 'But if I had a wife gay and handy, I would comfort her all day and night, She should smoke a cigar and drink brandv, And knock me about when she liked.
