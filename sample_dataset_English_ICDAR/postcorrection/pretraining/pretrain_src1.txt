 You miners all attend to these lines that I have penn’d Concerning the reduction of our pay, Jit the present time you know, our wages are so low, We can hardly earn half-a-cvown a day.
 V A precarious trade is the miners, 25AP/8 And that the coal and iron-masters know, If we strike, they say we’ll starve, and that we ddiPt deserve, If we go to work we might be killed below.
 For these two or three years gone by, miner’s wages they were high, But now they’ve got a great and sudden fall ! To support our wives and bairns it takes now all one earns, It’s a wonder how poor colliers live at all.
 When the coals they were so dear, the people far and near> The poor colliers got the blame you may be bound> But the masters I declare, always claim the lion’s share) For we only get two shillings in the pound.
 Mine owners they are hard, and do not us regard, For they’re all a set of greedy grabbing knaves ; Down in the gloomy mine, where the sun does never shine, They keep us working for them there like slaves.
 They’ve their halls and pleasure grounds their coaches, horses, and hounds, And they live upon the fat from off the land, Going to operas, balls, and plays, they spend their nights and days, Never thinking on the honest working man.
 If our masters only knew the hardships we go through, While toiling for our bread beneath the ground, They would with us sympathize, and their workmen they would prize, For the miners all the wealth for them have found.
 M’Donald is our friend, and on him we may depend, The advice he gives is good we can’t deny ; He wants us to combine, and the ‘ Unicn ’ all to join Then our tyrannic masters we’d defy.
 PADDY@CASEY@@ @@@@$ Paddy Carey is the name of the boy I’m going to sing, He’s a regular true-born Irish lad, and as happy as a king@; He lately came of age, and such a knowing card, For he resolved to hold a levee down in Laundry Yard.
 And you should have seen us there, a treat I do declare, All so frisky, drunk on whisky, driving away despair, There was fighting to be sure, for you could hear them squall, The night was spent in devilment at Paddy Carey’s Ball.
 The Ball took place as you shall hear, one winters night iu June, There was about three dozen people, just enough to fill the room ; The piper was perched upon the chair, ’twas a treat to hear him call, Now, my lads, let’s have a jig, and that commenced the ball.
 There was eating, there was drinking, there was whis@ ky in galore, Some were drunk upon the seats, some laid on the floor, Paddy Carey’s chairman, sure, was in a bran new suit of togs, And some walked in with dancing pumps, and some came in clogs.
 The dancing went on all serene, and some songs were sung, , . And just by the way of a little treat the cushion dance begun; . Paddy Carey jealous got, because the piper kissed his w if e He took the poker from the grate, and swore he’d take his life, The blood it poured down his face, like a madman he did shout, Murder ! murder@! fetch the police—I’ll have them all turned out.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ 8 Remarks on Des-Cartes's Part.
 I.
 to conceive, That whatsoever thinks does not Exist at the Time of its Thinking : Wherefore he con‑ cludes, That he is, and that he Thinks, is of all the most certain Truth that can be acquired by Philosophical Order.
 Who would not judge, That so wild an In‑ vention as this, in order to Improve Know‑ ledge , might not rather proceed from some Person in Bedlam , than from Des‑Cartes@? Of whom if Interrogated, how he comes to sup‑ pose, That a Man may point‑blank, on the ac‑ count of his Fiction, deny the Being of a God, together with all the viffble Particulars already mention’d ? As to the Existence of the Deity, he that conffders the nece@@ty of its Conce@@on, as he beholds the wonderful Conduct of the Universe, with so many miraculous Objects as are contain’d therein, will as soon give credit to any Forgery of Fables, as to doubt of the World’s Omnipotent Creator.
 And no less im‑ po@@ble to acquiesce in his other Suppofftions ; there being no Body that has his Eyes to See , and Hands and Feet,can doubt, That he discerns That which is called Heaven above his Head, and that he feels with Hands , and treads on the Earth with Feet.
 But, if you’l pass the Suppofftion of Des‑Cartes, he will assure you, That both Seeing and Feeling is not so In‑ telligible FRIER RUSH. 142 A Misffon as the steps of perse- cution can raise them ; and there is no Ladder so good as this of the Cross to scale by : and in our invitation to the nuptial Supper of the Lamb, it is not humility , but rather pufflanimity, to aim to fft down but in the lowest place ; they who point no higher, deffgn to stay too near@@ the door,and so may more eafflier fall s@hort of that than they who aspire@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Sectio Trigeffma prima.

@@@, II. @@v. @@@2. @@@@@@1597. Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image, And mock your workings in a second body.
 Question your royal thoughts ; make the case yours ; Be now the father, and propose a son ; Hear your own dignity so much profaned, See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted, Behold yourself so by a son disdained ; And then imagine me taking your part, And, in your power, soft silencing your son ; After this cold considerance, sentence me ; And as you are a king, speak in your state, What I have done that misbecame my place, My person, or my liege's sovereignty.
 K.
 You are right, Justice, and you weigh this well, Therefore, still bear the balance and the sword ; And I do wish your honours may increase Till you do live to see a son of mine Offend you, and obey you, as I did.
 So shall I live to speak my father's words :  ' Happy am I, that have a man so bold, That dares do justice on my proper son ; And no less happy, having such a son, That would deliver up his greatness so Into the hands of justice '.
 You did commit me ; For which I do commit into your hand The unstained sword that you have used to bear ; With this remembrance,  that you use the same, With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit, As you have done 'gainst me.
 There is my hand ; You shall be as a father to my youth ; My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear ; And I will stoop and humble my intents To your well-practised wise directions.
