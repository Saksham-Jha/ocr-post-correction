@24 CBA%ACTE\S An vnvortbie Knight@@@@.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @@@@i@@@@@@@@@@@@$« @@@@9 @@@1 @@@@4 @Hfe foule Refuse, and the defect of Nature, * To Fortitude, and Honour true, a Traytor.
 When to advance, his Valour it occurs, i/is Blade js blunt, and hee wants rav@dl’d Spurres.
 A Cypher in Court, a Sheepe in the Campe, Yet lyke Tytidbs in the streetes will stampe.
 Hee is amongst Men, lyke Owlcs amongst *2iid$, shaming the Sword, to his fide that hee girds.
 Hee counts for no sPromife, nor Honour, nor Fayth ( Gaine once hee his point@) that hee plighted hath.
 A Friend, or a Foe, hee finely can faine, Grace thtc even now, and gloorne on thee againe, Hee’s worlhipt for his Wealth@, not for his Wit,* Neyther was Valour t he worker of it.
 Where Courage for Honour doth enterpryse, Th’vnworthie Knight lyke to a Lubbard lyes.
 When Magnaniraitie with Courage strong, Through s PerilI pastes to repate a Wrong.
 H*ee saintly seares,@aud Couragelest^ hee quakes, And to heare these v^ttempts such Terrour takes, That all his Sprites@* they post from him apace* w^nd £ead-Iyke, iiue-ldle , hee lookes in the Face.
 Hee is the Chylde of Pry de, that doth despise* The truelie Worthie, that through Vertue ryfe.
 Hee's Follies Fav’rite@, full of Ostentation, And onlie mightie in Imagination.
 In Honours Court@, yet there bee no such ^pes, Knights bot in Cloathes@, and Cavelliers in Shapes. Vnto the Mould whereon they moue > bot Master, And God forbid our Countrey breed such Affes.
