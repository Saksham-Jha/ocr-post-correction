 I F danger were feared from a ruinous building, the Prætor might cause lecurity to be given@, or the@possdlion of@che building to be yeelded up.
 Tit@@m having a ruinous house, and M&v@'m a house in good repaire adjoyning to it@, Lucius@, whose house was joyned to that of Mevhut, desired , that the owners of both, might secure his house from danger.
 It was questioned, Whether MœvUu@, whose house was in good repaire@, might be compelled thereunto? Vlpian answered , That he was as well liable, as Ttti@wi because it might happen that the ruinous house, falling on that which was of good repaire, might occasion that house, to beat downe the house of Lucius: and if it be said, that there is no fault in the house of M&v@@hm, being in good repaire, if the ruinous house, falling on it@, should occasion Iosle, or@dammage to the third.
 It is answered, That Msvi@w, the owner of the house in repaire, is deservedly questioned* because he omitted to pro- vide for his own indemnity*, which he might have done, by procuring @7'itm to have entered bond, to five him harmlesle from any dammage,@which might happen to him, by the house of @@titm.
