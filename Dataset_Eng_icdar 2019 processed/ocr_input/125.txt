(' 35 ) i The hope which gladden’d David’s hear! my mercy hath made sure.
 ;5 Behold he comes@! your leader comer, with might and honour crown’d@; A witness, who ihall spread my name to earth’s remotest bound.
 6 See ! nations hasten to his call from ev’ry distant shore ; I@lks yet unknown Ihall bow to him, anti Il’ra’i’s Got! adore.
 7 Seek ye the Lord, while yet his ear is open to your call@; While olfer’d mercy still is near, be@ime his footstool fall.
 8'Let linnets quit their evil ways, their evil thoughts forego@; And God, when they to him return, returning grace will sliow.
 9 He pardons with o’evfiow ing love : for hear the voice divine@: My nature is not like to yours, r.or like your ways are mine : 10 Bat lar as heav’n’s resplendent orbs beyond earth’s spot extend, As tar my thoughts, as far my ways, your v.ays and thoughls @immseena.
