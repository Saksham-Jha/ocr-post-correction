 What G@ANGANELLI said of the Jesuits @may be well applied to these @@men ; when once they are done away, religion will reform of itself.
 The @learned @Dr.
 MIDDLETON, Librarian of the University of Cam‑ bridge, who was abused in his day for being too rea‑ sonable a Christian, has made so complete a prophecy of the present dangers of the Church, and pointed out so exactly this necessity of enlarging the pale @of ortho‑ doxy, that I may be well excused for@ incorporat@‑ ing his words with these Essays.
 @"These contro‑ versies, I @ﬂatter myself," says@ t@he Doctor, @"may still be seasonable and serviceable, towards check‑ ing that spirit of disa@ﬀection which in every part of the kingdom is visibly exerting itself against the Established Religion, by all the various arts which Popery, Methodism, and In@ﬁdelity can supply : the growth of all which has of late years been greatly complained of by the Clergy.
 For as this increasing evil is owing partly to certain articles, publicly pro‑ fessed and imposed by our Church, which are justly liable to exception ; and partly@ to groundless pre‑ judices, and false notions of religion in general, con‑ ceived by the weak, and con@ﬁrmed in them by@ the crafty ; so it cannot possibly be cured by any other method, than by placing the common Religion of Christians on its right foundation, the G@ospel, and clearing our particular system of it from all just o@ﬀence, and reducing it to its original simplicity and conformity with the natural law or reason of man ; @which, in all questions whatsoever, is the primary guide and ultimate test of right and wrong, truth a@nd @falsehood, to the whole human species.

 The arbitrary@ imposition of opinions naturally creates a reluctance to the recep‑ tion of them ; and as in the collision of@ bodies, so of minds, the @repelling force@ is equal t@o that @which im‑ pells : but if opinions were proposed to the public, with a latitude of interpretation, which left every one at liberty to receive them according to his own sense, and to embrace the@m either as true, or to acquiesce in them as expedient ; it would cut o@ﬀ both the pretence and the inclination to @wrangle about them ; and we should enjoy them with@ the same ease as we @do the common air or water, take just as much of them as we please, without o@ﬀence or injury to any one else.
 @By this means the virtuous and the liberal would be‑ come united in a@ﬀection as well as opinion, and live not only with more charity towards each other, but by their example and moderation, would lead the multitude also by degrees into more reasonable no‑ tions of religious duties ; so far at least, as to prevent them from being seduced into a@ny extravagance of zeal and principles, either Popish or Fanatical, which might create danger and disturbance to the peace of the kingdom.

 Much might be e@ﬀected against the increasing in@ﬂuence of the Methodists by rivalling their own zeal ; but in the present state of the Church tenets, such an activity is not to be expected.
 I do believe it impossible for the great majority of the Established Church to insist with any vehemence upon the belief in abstruse and useless mysteries ;@ and if they did, they would he doing wrong.
 Make them easy upon the most di@@ﬃcult points, and they will feel more satisfac‑ tion in being earnest.
 There might still remain a number of indolent an@d indi@ﬀerent men who would take no pleasure in expounding what they would never take pains to understand ; but there is no esta‑ blishment into which such men will not intrude, and it would be enough if the spirit of inquiry and general collision of mind, which would follow a reformatino of the Church, should keep these persons out of the way of publicity and preferme@nt.
 T@he present luke‑ warmness of the Established Preachers is a fertile and @very natural topic of rebuke with the Methodists, who know how to draw their advantages from contrast. For the space of eight years, during which I was at a public school, I recollect perfectly well that I saw two preachers every Sunday, but as to hearing th@em, I cannot speak with any exactness at this distance of time.
 I do not think either, that I ever heard one of the Bishops preach except the late Dr.
 HORS@LEY, but then I must do myself the justice to say that I have been present at several of their discourses, which must have been highly edifying to the clerk.
 It is due however to the celebrated Dr. PARR to declare, that when he preached his last Spital Sermon. I heard him in the aggregate for a whole hour, which I conjecture was about half the time in which be favoured the aldermen with his opinions on charity.
 It must be confessed that the delivery of these gentlemen is not calculated to make very vivacious impressions on the general mind.
 I say little of that host of poor Curates, who have really so much to do that they cannot exert themselves to any e@ﬀect, or of those nests of luxurious dignitaries who are worse@ than ine@@ﬃcient, @beca@use they do nothing.
 Many of the misfortunes of the Church are to be found out of it : foolish parents w@ho worship the gentility of a@ religious profession, and corrupt pa‑ trons who worship no religion at all, produce the two Church extremes of poverty and luxury ; @and nothing but the universal freedom of inquiry will annihilate the slavery and oppression that degrade and defeat the strongest talents.
 @When the Clergy have a greater respect for their own conscie@nces,@@ they will have a greater respect for t@he proper exercise of their pro‑ fession ; and we shall see less of those indi@ﬀerent readers ; those racers and chasers through the Litany ; those stop‐watch sermonizers who dispense@ the G@@@@@race of God as if they were bidding you good morning ; those preachers in short whether feeble or fantastic, who pick their teeth, as it @were, in God's presence, ridiculous when they are not heard and useless w@@@he@@n they are.
