 When to advance, his Valour it occurs, @His Blade is blunt, and hee wants ravell'd Spurres.
 A Cypher in Court, a Sheepe in the Campe, Yet lyke TYTIDES in the streetes will stampe.
 Hee is amongst Men, lyke Owles amongst @Birds, Shaming the Sword, to his ffde that hee girds.
 Hee counts for no @Promise, nor Honour, nor Fayth ( Gaine once hee his point ) that hee plighted hath.
 A Friend, or a Foe, hee @ﬁnely can faine, Grace thee even now, and gloo@me on thee againe. Hee's worshipt for his Wealth , not for his Wit,@ Neyther was Valour t@he worker of it.
 Where Courage for Honour doth enterpryse, Th'vnworthie Knight lyke to a Lubbard lyes.
 When Magnani@mitie with Courage strong, Through@@ Perill passes to repare a Wrong.
 H@ee faintly feares, and Couragelesse hee quakes, And to heare these @Attempts such Terrour takes, That all his Sprites , they post from him apace, @And Lead lyke, Liue‐Iesse , hee lookes in the Face.
 Hee is the Chylde of Pry@de, that doth despise, The truelie Worthie, that through Vertue ryse.
 Hee's Follies Fav'rite , full of Ostentation, And onlie mightie in Imagination.
 In Honours Court , yet there bee no such Apes, Knights bot in Cloathes , and Cavelliers in Shap@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@es.
