 Set A waiter for that purpose. The Celler Boy. ( 12 ) And can without (good Rob@in ) goe Unto the Rose, and to and fro, Which for the rest, I tell you so, S' a hard thing.
 But there is Jack@ the boy, more raving, Then Ralph unfed, and alwa@ies craving, Or else no quietnesse you have in The Prison.
 Who payes, is all h'has learned yet An@d how to carry, and to fett, And on your money @ﬁrst to sett His eyes on.
 But Jack and Ralph di@ﬀer in notes, Jack has' the sweeter,( though sharpe notes ) For he does ffng away our groates All day long: And Ralph is taught to cry Score, Score, (But never Ralph said any more) Nor Dunns us at out chamber doore For fayling.
 Touch pott touch penny, so that I Had rather heare the Raven cry, Then Jac@k should ffng so sorrily@, It grateth To pay ones money, 'fore we drink, And draw (as soone drawne as our chinck,) My soule abhorrs it, and I think It hateth@.
 But patience (my friends) perforce, Pray heaven it be not yet farre worse ! And Jack and Ralph the lesser curse Be counted.
 @Unles@se his Highnesse please by's powers To open yet the Prison doores, And let us pay our Creditors, Once mounted@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@.
