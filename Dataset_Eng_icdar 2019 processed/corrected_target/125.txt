 ( 35 )@@ The hope which gladden'd David's heart my mercy hath made sure.
 @5 Behold he comes ! your leader comes, with might and honour crown'd ; A witness, who shall spread my name to earth's remotest bound.
 6 See ! nations hasten to his call from ev'ry distant shore ; Isles yet unknown shall bow to him, an@d I@sra'l's Go@d adore.
 7 Seek ye the Lord, while yet his ear in open to your call ; While offer'd mercy still is near, before his footstool fall.
 8 Let ffnners quit their evil ways, their evil thoughts forego ; And God, when they to him return, returning grace will s@how.
 9 He pardons with o'erflow@ing love : for hear the voice divine : My nature is not like to yours, @nor like your ways are mine : 10 But far as heav'n's resplendent orbs beyond earth's spot extend, As far my thoughts, as far my ways, your @ways and thoughts transcend.
