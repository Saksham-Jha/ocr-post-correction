 Titius having a ruinous house, and Mævius a house in good repaire adjoyning to it , Lucius , whose house was joyned to that of Mævius, deffred , that the owners of both, might secure his house from danger.
 It was questioned, Whether Mævius, whose house was in good repaire , might be compelled thereunto? Vlpian answered , That he was as well liable, as Titius; because it might happen that the ruinous house, falling on that which was of good repaire, might occaffon that house, to beat downe the house of Lucius: and if it be said, that there is no fault in the house of Mævius , being in good repaire, if the ruinous house, falling on it , should occaffon losse, or dammage to the third.
 It is answered, That Mævius, the owner of the house in repaire, is deservedly questioned; because he omitted to pro‑ vide for his own indemnity ; which he might have done, by procuring Titius to have entered bond, to save him harmlesse from any dammage, which might happen to him, by the house of Titius.
