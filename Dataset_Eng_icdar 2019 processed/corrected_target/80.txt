 The PREFACE.
 If the Souls of all Mankind be commit‑ ted to Bodies , by God, as so many Thinking Substances ; it must necessarily follow, that they all had a precedent Creation ; and there‑ fore could lose nothing of their Perfe@ction, until joyn'd to the Body.
 But if according to the Opinion of Some , the Soul is traductionally produc'd , and born @with the Body , as the dispari‑ ties and temperatures of Men, both in Mind and Person, seem to be exerted, either from A@@ﬃnity in Blood, or pa‑ rentally propagated by the Connexion of the Bodily Parts and Senses ; it must according to that Tenent, be materially produc'd.
 Wherefore 'tis far more probable , if the Soul be granted a Thinking Substance united to the Senses, by the Ordainment of the Almighty : Than to allow it , as does Des‑Cartes , seperately and actively intel‑ ligent in the Body of Man.
