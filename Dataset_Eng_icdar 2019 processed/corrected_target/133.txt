 Ob@liq@@uangled Parallellograms are such as have oblique Angles, viz. two acu@te, and two obtuse. Of these there are@ two kinds, the Rhombus, and the Rho@mboidles.
 XXII.
 The Rhombus is a Figure that hath e‑ qual Sides, but @no right Angles, (like the form of a Diamond on the Cards, or the most ordinary Cut of Glass in Windows@) whose opeffte An‑ gles are equal.
 XXIII.
 The Rhomboi@des is (as it were) a de‑ fective Rhombus, for if from any ffde of a Rhom‑ bus we cut o@ﬀ a part with a parallel Line, the Remainder will be a Rhomboides, which hath neither equal Sides nor Angles, but yet the op poffte Sides and Angles are equal.
 XXIV.
 The Trapezium is a Figure that is neither parallellogram, nor (consequently) hath equal Sides or Angles, but is irregularly qua‑ drangular, as if drawn at adventure.
 Of this shape most Fields prove, that seem to the Eye to be Squares or Oblongs.
 XXV.
 Multangular Figures are such as con‑ tain more Sides and Angles than four, and they are either regular or irregular.
 XXVI.
 Regular Multangulars take their names from their Number of Angles, so a Pentagon, Hexagon, Heptagon, Octogon, Encagon, Decagon, ffgni@ﬁe a multangular Figure of @ﬁve, ffx, seven, eight, nine, ten, Angles, and coniequently Sides.

 An irregulár Polygon or multangular Figure, is that which hath more Angles ( and Sides ) than sour, the Sides (and Angles) being unequal to one another.
