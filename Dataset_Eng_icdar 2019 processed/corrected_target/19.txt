The Order and Method of the Discourse of Childrens Diseases.
 It is answered, 1.
 Every Age is ob‑ noxious to all kinds of Diseases, but one Age is more disposed to some Diseases , then another is ; for every Age hath a peculiar temper, and so a ffmilitude with some Diseases , whereby it is more eaffly a@ﬀected and changed by them @then by other Diseases ; nevertheless , Age it self doth not produce Diseases , but only disposes and makes one apt to receive certain sorts of Diseases ; for Age is a thing that is natural , and a De‑ termination of a time ; and it is de@ﬁned by some to be a Space and Duration of Life , in which the Constitution of the Body is manifestly changed, by the Acti‑ on of the natural heat upon the radical Moisture.
 The Life of Man conffsts in Heat and Moisture , the Heat consumes by degrees the Moisture , whereby ne‑ ce@sarily follows several Changes of the Temperament, which are called Ages.
