 Yes, Sir, 'tis true about three weeks ago you ſent me in the evening to carry a watch to a young gipſy you were in love with.
 I came back to my lodg- ing, my cloths all cover'd with dirt, and my face bloody, and told you I had met with thieves, who had beat me unmercifully, and robb'd me of the watch.
 'Twas I, Sir, who kept it.
 Leander.
 Did you keep the watch ? Scapin.
 Yes, Sir, that I might ſee what o' clock it is.
 Leander.
 So, ſo, theſe are fine things I learn here, and I have a mo@ faithful ſervant, in good truth.
