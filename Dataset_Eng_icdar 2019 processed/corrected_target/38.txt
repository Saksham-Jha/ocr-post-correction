 ( 65 ) 6 That at this name, with sacred awe,@@ each humbled knee shall bow,@@ Of hosts immortal in the skies,@@@ and nations spread below ; 7 That all the prostrate pow'rs of hell@@ might tremble at his word,@@ And ev'ry tribe, and ev'ry tongue,@@ confess that he is Lord.

 @1 @T AKE comfort, Christians ! when your@@@@ in Jesus fall asleep ; [friends@@ Their better being never ends ; why then dejected weep@@ ? 2 Why inconsolable, as those@@ to whom no hope is giv'n ?@@ Death is the messenger of peace, and calls@ the soul to heav'n.
@@ 3 As Jesus dy'd, and rose again victori'us from the dead ;@@@ So his disciples rise, and reign@@@@ with their triumphant Head.
 4 The time draws nigh, when from the clouds Christ shall with s@houts descend,@@ And the last trumpet's awful voice the heav'ns and eart@h s@hall rend.
