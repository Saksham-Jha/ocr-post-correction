 (40) And how it got the upper hand of your precede@nt Order so well Constituted before, if we may beleeve those men whose profe@@on gives them cause to enquire most, it may be doubted there was in it the fraud of some old patentees and monopolizers in the trade of book‐selling ; who under pretence of the poor in their Company not to be defrauded, and the just retaining of each man his severall copy, which God forbid should be gainsaid, brought divers gloffng colours to the House, which were indeed but colours, and serving to no end except it be to exercise a superiority over their neigh‑ bours, men who doe not therefore labour in an honest profe@@on to which learning is indetted , that they should be made other mens vassalls.
 Another end is thought was aym'd at by some of them in procuring by petition this Order, that having power in their han  , malignant books might the eaffer scape abroad,as the event shews. But of these Sophisms and Elenchs of marchandize I skill not : This I know, that errors in a good government and in a bad are equally almost incident; for what Magistrate may not be mis‐inform'd,and much the sooner, if liberty of Printing be reduc't into the power of a few ; but to redresse willingly and speedily what hath bin err'd@, and in highest autority to esteem a plain advertisement more then others have done a sumptuous bribe,is a vertue(honour'd Lords and Commons) answerable to Your highest actions, and whereof none can participat but greatest and wisest @men. The End.
