 remorse H EE is the Worke of Violence and Wrath, The @Sonne of Sinne, but Hope, but Loue of Faith: Who beeing borne , for Service of the Devill, But Care doth all , and all hee doth is Evil@l.
 No Villanie escapes him , that hee can: For loathsome Sinnes delighteth most this Man.
 His Wits are wandring , weake , and still v@nstable, His @Speech prophaine , impure , vnpro@ﬁtable.
 His Actions orderlesse, and scelerate; Corrupted all, curst, and contaminate.
 With all these Ills, that with the Fiends downe fell, From th’highest Heaven, vnto the lowest @Hell.
 For Wisdome , stands his Will: which while its so, Bot Furie , or bot Follie , ﬂows there‐froe.
 Hee’s full of In@ﬁdelitie , Mistrust, @And onlie doth delight t’injure the Iust.
 The Simple hee deceiues , and sucks the Blood; @And vnder Trust , of th’Innocent and Good.
 His @Breath is bot the Blast of Blasphemie, @@And all his Practise proues Impietie.
 His Conscience cauteriz’d , his Senses seard, His Heart is hardned , and hee is not feard To Fault and Fall , bot like a Free‐man fares, And nev’r in Publicke his Trespa@@ng spares. Hee worships seldome , and it is in vaine, Like Cains Sacri@ﬁce , because prophane.
 Hee is indur’d, an Out‐cast from the LORD; Impenitent, vnmyndfull to remord.
 His wicked wishes are the wracke of those, That Vertous , godly are , and Vices Foes.
 Hee loues Confuffon , and deffres Disorder, @A@nd @Boucher‐like , bathes in the Blood of Murder. T’oppresse and spoyle@, hee bot a Mirding makes, @@And scorns the Law, when hee her Statutes breaks.
 And bee hee put in a respected Place, The Good they smart, the guiltie gets the Grac@@@@e@@@@.
