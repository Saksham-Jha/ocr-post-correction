@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ This Name may upon this account be given to the common operations of Arith- me@tick ; as for instance, to what @we call Substiraction, Diviffon, Extraction of Roots, &c.
 for Substraction is nothing else but a Dissolution or Resolution of what is suppos’d to be compounded, or made up by Addition ; and Diviffon a re- solution of what is suppos’d to be made up by Multiplication ; as likewise Ex- traction of the squarc Root@, is a reso- lut@ion of what is supposed to be made up by squaring ; But such resolutions being eaffe, are not called Algebra, for the resolution of things, whereof the compo- fft@ion is more intricate, is more properly understood by this harsh word.
 The Arabs call it Algibr Walmo- kabala@ , from the first of these two words we call it Algebra, which taken together, imply the Art of Restitution and Resolution.
 Lucas de B@urgo, the most ancient European Algebrist, calls it the Rule of Rest@aur@at@ion and Oppoff- tion. And 4 The Academy of Sciences.
