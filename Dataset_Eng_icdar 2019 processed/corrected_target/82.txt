 The PREFACE.
 If the Souls of all Mankind be commit‑ ted to Bodies , by God, as ſo many Thinking Sub@ances ; it mu@ nece@arily follow, that they all had a precedent Creation ; and there‑ fore could loſe nothing of their Perfe@@ion, until joyn'd to the Body.
 But if according to the Opinion of Some , the Soul is traduionally produc'd , and born @with the Body , as the diſpari‑ ties and temperatures of Men, both in Mind and Perſon, ſeem to be exerted, either from A@@ﬃnity in Blood, or pa‑ rentally propagated by the Connexion of the Bodily Parts and Senſes ; it mu@ according to that Tenent, be materially produc'd.
 Wherefore 'tis far more probable , if the Soul be granted a Thinking Sub@ance united to the Senſes, by the Ordainment of the Almighty : Than to allow it , as does Des‑Cartes , ſeperately and a@ively intel‑ ligent in the Body of Man.
