@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ her burn my meat or oversalt my broth.
 I live by good soup, and not by fine language.
 Vaugelas does not teach how to make good soup ; and Malherbe and Balzac, so learned in fine words, would have been blockheads per- haps in the kitc@hin.
 Philaminta How terribly this gross discourse shocks me ! And how unworthy it is of one who calls himself a man, to be continually bent to material cares instead of raiffng himself up towards spiritual ones ! Is the body, that rag, of importance enough, of a value to merit a ffngle thought ? And ought we not to leave that far be- hind ? Chrisalus.
 Ay, but my body is myself, and I'll take care of it.
 A rag, if you please, but my rag is dear to me.
 Belisa.
 The body with the mind, brother, makes a figure ; but if you'll believe all the learned world in the case, the mind ought to have the precedency@ over the body ; and our greatest care, our first concern, should be to nourish it with the juice of science.
 Chrisalus.
 I faith, if you think about nourishing your mind, 'tis with very airy diet, as every one says ; and you have no care, no solicitude for   Philaminta.
 Ah ! Solicitude is coarse to my ear, it smells strangely of antiquity.
 Belisa.
 'Tis true the word is of high date.
 Chrisalus.
 Will ye let me speak ? In short I must be plain, pull off the mask, and discharge my spleen ; people treat you as if you were mad, and I'm heartily troubled @ @ Philaminta.
 How ? C@hrisalus to Belisa.
] 'Tis to you that I speak, ffster.
 The least solecism in speech provokes you ; but you THE LEARNED LADIES. 26
